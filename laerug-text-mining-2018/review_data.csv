https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875572/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875572,NA," A really nice, funny movie for Christmas despite a little bit of the inevitable smaltz
","Accidentally finding his way into Santa's bad once Christmas Eve, little baby orphan Buddy ends up in the north pole, where he is raised by the elves as one of their own.  As he gets ever bigger and less and less suited to the elf lifestyle he is told about his real father and decides to go to New York to find him.  However Buddy's natural smile and elfish enthusiasm doesn't really fit in with New York, not to mention a father who rejects him.When I first saw the trailer for this film I laughed slightly but I also thought that it could easily be just awful.  Despite this fear I decided to go and see it on the basis of seeing Ferrell in the Reloaded MTV spoof on the DVD and being very funny.  I was glad that I did as the film was refreshingly funny very enjoyable despite the weaknesses inherent in a seasonable film of this nature.  The jokes are a mix of adult and children - but not separately, the humour is of a nature families can all enjoy rather than being of a `one for me and one for the kids' type.The film does get a little sweet towards the end, but it manages to avoid this usual trap for the majority of the film and can't be expected to not be all Christmas cheer at some point!  The fish out of water stuff is pretty funny and Farrell makes his character funny without being annoying to the audience (as he feared he might be from the trailer).  Caan is good but has to work with the `scrooge' character of the film and thus gets fewer laughs. The support cast is good with fun turns from Newhart, Asner and Steenburger.It does get a little sickly sweet towards the end and the fish out of water jokes do wear a little thin towards the end but mostly it is very funny and refreshingly fun to watch.  The film is made better by a performance from Farrell that is perfectly pitched without being annoying and full of spark and wit.","

","This was my 4th viewing and now ready to review.The story is insane. This film should not have worked. But almost as a tribute to the X-Mas miracles it tries to riff off, it is an astonishingly entertaining film.Behind the camera Favreau, Mr Money Shot, who has quietly without fanfare turned into one of the hottest directors in Hollywood history. In front of the camera Farell who I usually don't care for but may just give the performance of his career here. A script to die for. Probably the best use of Zoey D's looks in her career to date.Way under rated and unappreciated.As in my other reviews, most ""recent"" X-Mas films (since about 2000) are Canadian B-movies shot on a budget which would barely cover a reno on THIS OLD HOUSE What an unexpected treat See it","

","This was one of my favorite movies in 2003. Will Ferrell is brilliant as the Elf. The supporting cast is great too, especially Bob Newhart as his elf ""dad"". The characters are well written and it is a refreshing film to get lost in. Will Ferrell plays the elf with such innocence, he is so funny! This is not just a Christmas film but when the DVD comes out I will be watching ""Elf"" in July. The story progresses nicely, there are many lessons to be learned as you watch this movie. It touched my heart in many ways. I highly recommend this movie for kids AND adults, you won't regret it. Treat yourself and watch this ""original"" movie. Hollywood needs to make more like this.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1785330/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1785330,7," A star is born in this laugh-out-loud holiday comedy...
","Charming Christmas confection--about a boy raised by elves in the North Pole who grows up and journeys to N.Y.C. in search of his biological father--puts a clever spin on even the most familiar gags, successfully walking a fine line between absurdist comedy and holiday schmaltz. Will Ferrell looks like a string-bean in yellow tights and, with his mass of curly hair peeking out from underneath his elf's hat, he could easily be used as a walking punchline. Fortunately, director Jon Favreau's handling of ""Elf"" is incredibly nimble, treating Ferrell and his naive character Buddy with the utmost respect; you can laugh at all the silly pranks without ever feeling guilty. Favreau's work is smooth, and he's assembled an incredible supporting cast of character actors to back his star, though some may find the climactic moments (involving Edward Asner as Santa Claus) a bit too literal--and the movie is certainly funnier before we get to this point. Still, the special effects are kept to a minimum in order to let the people shine...and that's not only refreshing, it's heart-warming. *** from ****","

","Will Ferrell does a great job here, and it's the perfect Christmas (Holiday) movie that can be enjoyed anytime of the year.The contrast of almost unbalanced folly of Will's character with those that encompass him, lends a great degree of innocence and non-stop joy and plenty of laughter as he leaves the mundane world of the usual, boring, and often time intolerance of the world in his dust.It's refreshing to see a story where others are encouraged to rise to the level of this main character instead of him being overwhelmed and dragged down by the majority of ""Cotten Headed Ninny Muggins"", a.k.a. the ""touch me not, speak to me not"" big city public psyche so familiar that many walk around with.For those that represent the general public in the movie, as well as the audience, Ferrell's character dares us to believe again, even for a moment of the magic of Christmas and tears down decades of political correctness to connect us with the late 60s and 70s when so many annual Holiday shows brought us a seemingly sustained desire to entertain ourselves with the magic that waxes then wanes but for a few short weeks each year. Whether a work of animation or raw theater, this refreshing story brings vitality and rekindles childhood memories for the kid in all of us.","

Ferrell gives an inspired lunacy turn as a man who was raised by elves at The North Pole and discovers to his dismay he's actually human sparking his quest to be re-united with his long-lost father (Caan in an inspired bit of casting), a 'naughty-list' occupant, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City, just in time for Christmas. Hysterically funny thanks to the goofy yet sweet and wonderful turn by Ferrell (no one else could pull off the razor's edge of looking like an idiot yet retaining the innocent glee of a child and bares a striking resemblance to Tom Hanks' turn in 'BIG') with a great cast especially the beguilingly pretty Daschanel as his fellow Santa's Little Helper at Gimbels'who he falls in love with. Directed with style and witty warmth by Favreau (who has a cameo) and written by newcomer David Berenbaum with a smart, fun script that caters to all ages with a nostalgic nod to classic animated holiday specials for good measure. An instant holiday classic. Trivia note: Billingsley, best known as Ralphie from the yuletide cinematic classic, plays 'A CHRISTMAS STORY' the elf foreman!","

","It was so nice to be able to sit down and watch a movie featuring an SNL actor without having to mute or fast forward any crude parts. Granted, this may not be Will Farrell's most amazing performance, but if you want a new Christmas movie to watch this season, I highly recommend Elf. I talked to a few people who thought the movie was stupid, but that was because they were expecting Will Farrell's character to be a duplicate of his SNL performances. So, to fully enjoy this movie, watch it without any expectations and remember that it's okay to have a childlike sense of humor--nobody's too cool for a great Christmas movie. I love most all the movies from Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Will Farrell, Jim Carrey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and David Spade, but most of them aren't appropriate for viewers of all ages. Elf is a movie you can throw in the VCR and not have to worry about what the kids hear or see on it. Thanks, Will, for putting out a hilarious movie that the whole family can watch!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875675/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875675,6," This will play on television every year for the rest of our lives
","This is a good natured holiday comedy that definitely is in the same realm as ""The Santa Clause"" and (Dare I say?) ""Miracle on 34th Street"". Story is about a human that has been raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole and as he gets older he figures out that he's very different from the other elves. Years earlier Santa (Ed Asner) was delivering at an orphanage and a human baby accidentally crawled into his sack and was taken back to the North Pole where he was raised by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart). He is called Buddy (Will Ferrell) and he grows to six foot three and one day he is told the truth about his situation and told by Santa who his real father is. Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and he heads to the Empire State Building where he works. He finds his father Walter (James Caan) who runs a publishing business and works all the time much to the chagrin of his family. Walter is unable to get away from Buddy and after a blood test proves he is his son he takes him home with him to stay with his family. He meets Walter's wife Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and their son and Walter thinks Buddy is just someone reverting to his childhood after a shock. Buddy starts to work in a department store and he meets a woman named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) and is smitten by her. Buddy tries to fit in with the others but finds it difficult although he becomes friends with Walter's son and starts dating Jovie.This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!","

IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THEM. I saw ""Elf"" when it was first released theatrically in 2003. I did not see it again until 2016. I forgot everything about this film. What I can't believe was that I forgot how wonderful this film was. It does everything you want in a ""Christmas"" movie. This film is full of ""Christmas Spirit"" that most films never seem to capture. In this film On Christmas Eve in 1973, an orphaned infant boy stows away on Santa Claus' sack. When discovered back at the North Pole, he is adopted by Papa Elf. Papa Elf names his son Buddy.Buddy grows up at the North Pole believing he is an elf, but due to his human size is unable to perform elf tasks. When Buddy accidentally learns that he is human, Papa Elf explains that he was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and was given up for adoption without Walter knowing. Susan died and Walter works at a book publisher in New York City. Buddy travels to find him, whom Santa indicates that Walter is on the naughty list due to his greed and selfishness. Buddy then is out to save Walter and Christmas itself. This should be on your must see watch list.","

A few scenes that made me laugh audibly, and a lot of scenes that made me smile.I didn't really give me anything new, the plot was very predictable and kind of tame. It was nice to see Will Ferrell in a role where his character didn't have these ridiculous scenes where he overplays to make it hilarious and just misses the spot. The funnier scenes were well played out by Will and fit the character of Buddy the Elf.Sounds like my impressions of the film doesn't coincide with my rating of it, but it was a perfectly fine Christmassy flick that left me with a smile.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1145852/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1145852,8," Ferrell finally finds something to contain him
","I do love Christmas movies, always a sucker for them even if the style and story is not new or different. Elf does bring some new story to the typical Christmas movie but for the most part it's same old, same old which for someone who loves the Christmas movie is great!! Unfortunately I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, okay granted I thought Night At The Roxbury was pretty funny but everything else since then has been horrid. Nonetheless with Elf Ferrell finally finds something that suits his completely child like annoying behavior and his over acting actually suits the character.Elf is the story of an orphan who accidentally makes his way into Santa's magical bag on Christmas Eve as a baby. When Santa discovers him he puts him in the care of the elves, in particular Papa Elf. The elves raise him as one of their own despite his size difference and a few other more human traits he is raised to believe he is just another Elf. Buddy as he is known has now reached the age that Papa Elf believes he should know the truth, especially considering that Buddy has a real father, alive and well who didn't even know he existed. Buddy is excited about making his way to New York City to meet his real father. He travels from the safe land of The North Pole where he knows and understands everything into the brutal modern world of New York City. Buddy sticks out like a sore thumb, and not just because of his green elf costume he insists on wearing but his politeness, his fascination with the simple annoyances of life, and his insistence that he is truly an elf from the North Pole. He finally tracks down his real father, Walter, a big time children's book publicist who spends more time working than with his wife and other son. Buddy tries to explain that he is Walter's son but Walter has him removed from the building. After being kicked out Buddy meets a friend in Jovie, a rather down on her luck Gimble's worker who plays an Elf for the Christmas season. Although first rather nervous about Buddy she begins to warm up to his childlike innocence. Buddy continues to do all he can to get back to see his Dad and eventually with a blood test Walter discovers this rather imbalanced man is indeed his son. Walter's wife Emily insists that Buddy stay with him. Buddy does everything he can to spread Christmas cheer and turn everything more ""Christmas-y"" wherever he goes. Unfortunately his ignorance to the real world infuriates Walter and he just wants Buddy to go away but both his wife and other son have become very attached to Buddy. Buddy tries his hand at working with Walter, which causes disaster, and eventually Buddy finds himself all alone until Santa has a bit of a disaster himself and crashes the sleigh into Central Park. The sleigh won't fly because their is no Christmas spirit left. Fortunately Buddy has touched enough people's lives for Jovie and Emily and Michael to bring Christmas spirit back for everyone including Walter who finally realizes what is important. Buddy will save Christmas for everyone!! Buddy is a great Christmas character. His naivety and ignorance is funny but touching and cute. Ferrell actually does manage to pull that off thank goodness. Although I don't know if they make Buddy pure enough that it actually comes across that he is touching these people's lives. The real laughs are with the physical comedy in the film, mostly entirely done by Ferrell but it's very funny. James Caan is so out of place and yet so perfect for the role of Walter. He fits in but doesn't at all which is kind of strange. Bob Newhart as the narrator and Papa Elf is also a great little cameo. And the great Ed Asner as bit rough around the edges but very caring Santa is also great. Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest Jovie is a good choice. Although at first she doesn't seem like the right pick they actually have decent chemistry and she plays her role with a lot of depth for the short time she gets. Director Jon Favreau does a good job of creating something I actually compared to the amazing classic Miracle on 34th Street. Much of this film reminded me of a more updated modern version of that film which is a great honor. While I don't think Elf has the staying power it's still a cute little Christmas film with a tolerable Will Ferrell and a good family film. Pick it up this Christmas or even if you just feel like being in the Christmas Spirit. 8.5/10","

","Elf (2003): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Bob Newhart: The story of little people doing big things, or in this case big people doing even bigger things. Will Ferrell stars as Buddy who crawled into Santa's sack upon his visit to the orphanage. He is raised at the North Pole where cheer and good will are the norm. When he learns that he is human he treks to New York to reunite with his human family. His father works in publishing and sees Buddy as a lunatic. He eventually lands a job in a toy store where a young lady with a winning singing voice catches his heart. Neat concept and funny situations and a conclusion where Buddy obtains the best of both worlds. Directed by Jon Favreau who previously made a very different film called Swingers. This time he aims for a different audience. He is backed by Ferrell with outrageous bursts of enthusiasm in an overgrown elf costume that is appropriately out of place. James Caan makes a great foil as his father. Zooey Deschanel is pleasant but as a female shop worker she is a predictable romantic prop. The biggest disappointment is Mary Steenburgen who is limited as Caan's wife. Bob Newhart narrates the film as Buddy's parental elf, which adds that fable like affect to its presentation. Hilarious Christmas comedy taking the elf theme to new heights. Score: 9 ½ / 10","

","At first glance, it's hard to imagine a less likely candidate for an unironic Christmas film than the director/star of the snappy, sardonic Swingers (and soon-to-be director of Iron Man, of all things). Yet, curiously enough, it's this particular background that makes Jon Favreau so well-suited (ha) for the job. Sharp enough not to tumble into the schmaltz too heavily but shrewd enough to recognize the value in playing it straight, Favreau's Elf hits the ideal balance between being fun for kids while clever and sweet enough to remain tolerable for adults without caving to becoming closeted-self-loathing. It's no wonder that such a comparatively recent film has already worked its way into vintage holiday movie canon. Favreau is evidently nostalgic for the good ol' days of Christmas flicks (check out the distinctly Rudolf-esq stop motion Arctic creatures and Seussian snowflakes, some of the film's most delightful additions), but is clever enough to have a good beat on what makes them tick. Like all the best elating seasonal fare, Elf delivers a story of a fish-out-of-water outcast struggling with abandonment and an inability to fit in, but finds inspiration in his unflinching cheeriness in the face of his adversity, and its infectious effect on the community. Between corporate office culture, rampant consumerism and the bedraggled staff responsible for hocking it, there's a fair share of Scrooginess proliferating the film, but, bouncing along like a pointy hat-sporting George Bailey, Buddy the Elf(/human? Elf-man? Humelf...?) remains such a radiantly positive character that it's impossible not to be won over by him, as the film's other characters echo.Though there are gleeful setpieces aplenty (the ""you're not Santa!"" toy store brawl is already iconic, but Buddy's proficiency in a snowball fight is just as wickedly fun), Elf works by never abandoning its core emotional story, weaving in touching beats throughout, as Buddy connects with his estranged ""naughty listed"" father and thug life brother, and clumsily wooes his jaded coworker (one of the film's few objectionable bits - while cute, it's a bit underdeveloped, not to mention eyebrow raise-worthy how quickly she acclimatizes to a romance with a man who, for all intents and purposes, has the mental facilities of a 12-year old...). Pacing-wise, the film ticks along at a satisfyingly jaunty rate, and it only helps that Favreau commits to the tone aesthetically, with popping, vibrant candy colours and soft-focus lighting that allows the film to almost literally sparkle. The climax, finding conflict in Santa's sleigh crashing in Central Park, beset by Nazgûl-like park rangers, would play as laughably shoehorned in if Favreau didn't deliver it with such a knowing wink, and, strained as it might feel, he pulls it off without distracting excessively. And aww shucks - who could begrudge to a finale that dives whole-hog into sentiment - a Christmas spirit-inducing sing-a-long, no less! - so confidently and unironically, that, unlike most such euphoric 'happy endings,' it actually works really well. Hell - if James Caan's humbug can sing along, you sure can too. It's impossible to imagine the film to work without the stupendous work of Will Ferrell powering it. Like Favreau, Ferrell has mastered a delivery that plays to multiple audiences at once, allow him to sound wholeheartedly sincere yet uproariously stupid in the same breath, yet uniquely lovable either way. In between the inevitable more kid-friendly slapstick (and thankfully only one burp joke), Ferrell is never crass about Buddy's childlike approach to life, mining it for the utmost of wide-eyed truth, and he's all the funnier and more adorably charming for it. The rest of the cast, thankfully, are game to echo Ferrell's spirit. James Caan is pitch-perfect as the curmudgeonly Scrooge too wrapped up in exploiting nuns and orphanages to pay attention to his giddy elf-son, while (a jarringly blonde) Zooey Deschanel showcases the luminescent, quirky charm that would shortly catapult her into stardom (she even sneaks in a couple of songs for good measure). Ed Astner's gruff warmth makes him the most definitive Santa Claus since Richard Attenborough, and the hangdog charm of Bob Newhart lends the film's narration a perfectly relaxed airiness. The ever-adorable Mary Steenbergen helps the film's emotional heart blossom as Caan's more amiable wife, while Daniel Tay avoids the curse of the obnoxious Christmas child star with an edgier and more sly precociousness. Favreau even sneaks in some parentally crowdpleasing cameos - hey there, Kyle Gass from Tenacious D and Andy Richter! - while Peter Dinklage just about walks off with the show with his sublimely preening rock star children's author. Confidently festive and heartwarming with just the right underbelly of snarky eye-rolling, Elf is a true delight, and one of the most worthwhile additions to the Christmas pantheon. Although it's not as ambitious or infused with an emotional home run as other holiday classics, it's inevitable that the Christmas cheer level on the Clausometer will receive a hefty boost upon viewing or revisiting Elf. I'm still not eating spaghetti with maple syrup, though. That's a step too far. -8.5/10","

","There are very few Christmas movies, or movies in general for that matter, that I could watch over and over again without getting sick of. 'Elf' is one of those movies. We're approaching the festive season as I write this review and, being such a crowdpleaser, this movie is already appearing in TV listings everywhere. It seems to grow in popularity year on year and it's hard to believe that it's been 14 years since its release.Will Ferrell without doubt makes the film what it is. He gets his character spot on and provides plenty of laughs for adults as well as kids. There are some hilarious individual scenes and the movie as a whole is just great fun, which is what Christmas movies should be. For sheer entertainment value, 'Elf' is without question one of the best.","

","I feel torn. On one hand, this was an extremely well-done movie. Very entertaining. Funny. Cute. Captured all of the elements one might require in a Christmas movie. On the other hand, I felt it was a little too cloying and saccharine. There were some very entertaining moments and good scenes, but it's obvious this movie was made for the whole family (which is fine) and, in the end, it didn't feel like a great movie. It felt like a good movie. You have to be ready to stomach the shmaltz, mind you (and there is a lot). I'm torn between rating it 6 or 7. Why? Because on one hand, the shmaltzy elements alienated me a bit from the film but on the other hand, the movie has heart and is essentially a feel-good Christmas movie with all the fixins. And, I don't want to come across like a Scrooge. It was well-filmed. Zooey looked beautiful. It was funny in a broad sort of way. James Caan isn't as badass or mean as you originally think, and in the end, he seems rather likable. My complaint is that the movie could have more edge. Maybe it's because I spent the last few days watching really good thrillers, but I felt like this movie could have had a darker dark side. For me, it would have enriched the experience. As it stands now, it's sweet, fun, harmless and stands alone as a rather storybook Christmas fairytale that can appeal to a huge demographic. But heed this warning: There are a large share of Christmas songs, and several shmaltzy moments. Add this to your Christmas movie list. It's worth it. It ain't the best, but it's a well put together little tale with enough funny moments to make the experience worthwhile. And a heckuva lot of Christmas spirit. Cheesy and cloying at times, but still... it's there. Enjoy it.","

Favreau squeezes every funny ounce out of putting Ferrell in small spaces and the guy really is an endearing spaz.

","(This review has spoilers, although I consider it a stretch to call them that due to the nature of this movie.) I was going to leave a comment without reading any others, because I had an idea what I would read, having heard lots of favorable opinions from others regarding this movie. Then I decided I really needed to read what others wrote, and my suspicions were confirmed precisely: Several people saying how great or cute this movie was, and the occasional person telling it essentially how it really was. I'll add to that. Was this movie just silly, which connotes an innocent lack of intelligent matter, or was it stupid, connoting something a bit deeper? Considering that movies (at least, the Hollywood variety) are created to make money, I'll put my money on the latter. Hollywood knows there are a lot of people out there who have nothing better to do with their money than to shell it out at the movie theater to watch something unoriginal, uncreative, and with roles that require no particular acting talent. These people also won't demand that, within whatever flight of fancy a story may take, the story follow rules it sets for itself. For instance, Buddy is required to eat, apparently, since he consumes voluminous portions at the meals we see, yet he travels quite some distance from the North Pole without eating--or sleeping, which is obviously something else he's required to do. He also is stupid/childlike for no reason for which we're ever made aware. He's stupid/childlike because he's grown up as an elf? Why then are not the other elves like that? If he's stupid because he's grown up with elves, why doesn't he start figuring things out once he's with humans?I guess the movie had quite a few funny scenes? I'm not sure which ones they were. The snowball fight wasn't bad. But the scene where he sings to his dad was not, the scene where his created Christmas display in the department store got destroyed was not, his belching was not, his answering his dad's phone ""Buddy the Elf--what's your favorite color?"" was not.It takes very little acting talent to act stupid through an entire movie, as did Will Ferrell. I think most anyone could do it. James Caan's role was one he's played a hundred times, and the same goes for Bob Newhart. Does no one ever get tired of that? A person searching for his father and trying to get him to change, even if the person doing the searching was raised as an elf, is not terribly original. To add further insult to our intelligence, not only was the scene where the father changes for the better highly predictable, it didn't even have a real buildup to get him to change! It was just, ""Okay Mr. Caan, your character has to have a change of heart now, please show us a change of heart"", and that was it. To annoy us even further, the girl of course decides she must sing out for everyone to hear. But none of this matters, because dimwits are cute and endearing, and sentimentality sells, regardless of the lack of intelligence attached to it.Thank you all for supporting this movie--you ensure that other garbage like this will be made many more times in the future.","

","I could not believe this movie at all. So many of the comments are about what a wonderful movie this is, and I watched this with my children in great anticipation, but I kept wondering, would anyone want to watch this more than once? I like sappy Christmas movies; they are fun. I even like fantasies based on a silly premise. To work, however, there must be some semblance of believability.The Elf character was so much over the top, that even as a non-human in a human body, he didn't quite fit reality. From the premise in the movie, elves are hard-working, optimistic, and encouraging, but they are not stupid. It was the other characters, though, that really stood out. When Buddy was doing his silly stuff, the other characters just stood there as if they were waiting for him to finish his lines, instead of reacting as you would expect New Yorkers to react to a wacko like that.James Caan was believable, but no one else was. That has to be laid at the feet of the writer and/or director.My opinion is clearly in the minority, but I thought this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875515/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875515,5," Ferrell tries his best, but the writing is unambitious and mediocre
","So-so film with a few really funny moments. It always seemed like the comedy could have gone two steps further than it did. There are tons of missed opportunities and jokes that are built up without payoff (the news broadcast at the end of the film is a perfect example). Elf earns points for being a decent family film in that it has almost no objectionable content  one very long belch is about it. It's nice that it doesn't resort to gross-out humor, but it could certainly stand to be less lame a lot of the time. Will Ferrell, a former Saturday Night Live actor, stars as a human who is raised by elves until his enormous height compared to the other elves makes this fact all too obvious. When Ferrell finds out that his father (James Caan) lives in New York City, he goes out and finds him. It becomes a standard fish-out-of-water comedy. The writing is half-hearted, so the weight of the movie ends up resting wholly on Ferrell, who does his damndest to carry it on his shoulders. I've always been a fan of Ferrell, even if he did create a couple of truly obnoxious characters on SNL. He actually does a fine job in Elf, playing a truly manic but sweet idiot. The filmmakers should have trusted Ferrell more, because it really shoots itself in the foot when it begins to concentrate on a very cheesy and unbelievable crisis in the elf's newfound human family. Ferrell has run away from home, and Caan and his family think they can find him in New York City  which, of course, they do. And Ferrell (along with his family and his girlfriend) have to convince the people of NYC to have faith in Santa Claus so his sleigh can fly. They do this by having the girlfriend (a very cute Zooey Deschanel, who might look a bit too much like Reese Witherspoon to become a star) sing 'Santa Claus Is Coming to Town' on the news. I was enjoying the film, but this kind of formulaic garbage just ruined it. It's nice to see Bob Newhart, Charles Durning, and Andy Richter. One of my favorite comediennes, Amy Sedaris, was also there somewhere, but I must have missed her (was she one of the elves?). 5/10.","

The product placements do get annoying, but mostly serve the script. Who knows if director Jon Favreau, who also has a cameo role, punched-up debut writer David Berenbaum's script, but it is delightful.Zooey Deschanel is a sweetheart, while James Caan and Mary Steenburgen just pretty much get to reprise their TV roles, in, respectively, ""Las Vegas"" and ""Joan of Arcadia.""The visual references to other movies are amusing, from the Disney-like animation at the North Pole to treating the Urban Park Rangers like the Dark Riders from ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""The holiday song selections are mostly classic, though it's nice to hear new Leon Redbone interpretations on two tracks.(originally written 1/19/2004)","

This must have been written by a 6 year old.*Spoilers* Don't say I did not warn you.Will is a human adopted by the elves at the north pole and the joke here is that he's 6 feet tall and the elves are still short. That's one punchline that's repeatedly shoved down our throats. I GET IT! It's not funny at all. He finds out that his old man(an embarrassed James Cann) is naughty and throws his usual annoying hissy fit. One thing that REALLY annoyed me was the scene in the mall. He erupts into a frenzy about the mall worker posing as a fake Santa. This is insanely annoying. The guy is dressed as Santa to serve some good kids, some bratty kids and does this for hours on end just so he can get an extra paycheck to feed his family and gets shouted at by some annoying jerk in an elf outfit. Leave him alone!! Let him do his job!! Also a cute woman dressed as an elf for some unexplained reason, gets a liking to this jackass. Another thing, If ELF was so offended by the fake Santa, why did he not throw a fit at the babe dressed as a fake elf?? She's a fraud too just like the guy dressed like Santa. Ferrell is naturally annoying as ELF. The ""comedy"" is stupidity. I almost feel sorry for James Caan. Perhaps Caan was here for another paycheck. Can't be for the script, which sucks.The Last Word: Avoid. Will Ferrell still sucks. A bad adaptation of a Christmas movie. Want a good Christmas movie? Try National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation or for kids, The animated Dr. Seuss's The Grinch who stole Christmas instead.","

","It is incomprehensible that this film garners a 7.1 on here. It's sappy, stupid and obnoxious. Used to be that stars who had a name would be worried about being involved in a film that was totally vapid. That day is long gone. The story is so stupid. The ending is so sentimental and dumb. As the sputtering blunderbus flew off during the climax of this piece of crap, I could only think of the scores of starving people who could have been fed instead of spending millions on this useless pablum. And John Favreau doing this is all the more hilarious. The way he chomps his cigar while waxing unpoetic about the biz on Bravo, you'd actually think he had more in mind than just cashing in on pieces of garbage like this. The whole cast looks like they are attending a wake except for Will Ferrell who turns in another classic post-SNL performance: one dimensional, schticky idiocy that might work in a 2m skit, but leaves you numb after an hour and a half.","

","Will Ferrell never seemed to do much on SNL so it was interesting to see the rave reviews of this movie when it came out.Why? It's abysmal in every respect: there are at most 2-3 good lines; only a couple of characters even start to develop and they choke after a short time; and maybe 1 funny scene.Ferrell spends the movie acting as adults act when they want to mimic childish behavior. He never hits any kind of stride. He is just never funny. Is it as bad as watching Jim Carrey? It's a toss-up.Jon Favreau's movies lean towards slapstick. This holds back on that in favor of letting Ferrell overact.Caan does a nice job, as always. But so what?As it happened, I saw this with The Wrong Guy. That film is clever, funny (hilarous in parts), sharp, inventive. Everything that Elf is not.","

","That's the only explanation I have in order to explain why such a sucky, corny and unfunny movie was such a huge hit at the b.o. and now on home video. So many people's brains are so numbed by drugs that something as awful as ELF can easily be considered a classic.What's remarkable is how unfunny and predictable ELF was. I knew things were going to happen several minutes even before they were going to happen (for example, the short writer...). And the film's corny attitude is so overwhelming, I cringed throughout the movie. This film is so corny, it could supply a years worth of high fructose corn syrup for Coca Cola, Pepsi, 7-up, Dr Pepper, Tab, RC Cola, Orange Crush, Kool-Aid AND every Kelloggs cereal in production!!! This film is so divorced from reality that it's unfunny. Yes, it's a fantasy. I'm aware of that but the employees at the mail room of the Empire State building are working on Christmas eve? I mean, come on! And I felt so bad for James Caan.If you like Will Ferrell's shtick, you'll probably like this movie. But for those, like me, who see Ferrell's shtick as something utterly annoying, avoid this movie at all cost!","

","The small children surrounding me didn't laugh at -Elf-.  Their small mouths grimly  wired shut, they didn't laugh at the ""zany"" hi-jinks, they didn't laugh at the ""jokes,"" and  they certainly didn't smile when Will Ferrill played ""cute.""  I can't blame them.  -Elf- is a  derivative, predictable march through a series of contrived mishaps and ham-fisted  doses of insipid tenderness.  James Caan is horribly miscast and fails to display any of  the warmth that his part calls for.  He's not even a good straight man.  He's just joyless  and angry, rushing through his lines.  At least, Bob Newhart does a decent job as a  fatherly elf.  And the special effects were pretty good.  I've never seen a better flying  sled.  Still though when the lights came on, the children and I felt more holiday despair  than joy.","

",I watched this last night as it was on TV and there was nothing on at all last night so I said since we are reaching the holidays I might as well watch it. The movie is similar to Enchanted in a way(minus the animation)and it tells the story of a man who is raised by Santa's elf's and he goes to NYC to find his biological father who is a writer apparently . Buddy(Ferrell) then meets a girl named Jovie(Zooey Deshnail who is a dead ringer to Katy Perry)and becomes smitten with her.I may not be a fan of Will Ferrell but I laughed at a few parts to this movie like the part where he is singing the Baby its cold outside song from Tom Jones and the part where he humiliates his father at work by some guy who he called an elf too LOL that was hilarious.The movie is a bit stupid but I like fish out of water movies as I like how the characters interact with our world and that. I liked some parts to it but the ending was quite dumb. So I am giving it a 6 simply because its nearly Xmas and I like to get into the Holiday season.,"

The bits here are strenuously unfunny. The movie is a schlocky piece of garbage lifting garbage-y ideas from other garbage-y movies. This movie doesn't have an inch of redeeming celluloid. Every copy of it should be collected and dumped into some live volcano. Then we should all pity the volcano... Favreau made it for his adolescent daughter. It is over-ripe maudlin, sentiment that stinks worse than the dirty diaper you stepped in, in the Red Lobster parking lot last week.

","Seriously. Will Ferrell comes across as some kind of retard who shouldn't be allowed anywhere near kids, let alone as one of Santa's Elves.I suppose my experience of this film is worsened by the fact of being stranded in a cheap motel in Canada during the holiday season while my ""companion"" insisted on watching this. She thought it was ""cute"". Nuff said.This is just such a loathsome, nauseating and at times, diabetes inducing, nightmare that I am at a loss for anything more constructive to say.I think I probably despise Will Ferrell even more than Jim Carrey after being exposed to this abomination, although I will admit they both give me the major creeps in very similar ways.I am pretty open minded about films. I didn't even mind Battlefield Earth or Barb Wire that much and I like all kinds of obscure art-house films as well as some of the lowest rated trash. But this?

","The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from the beginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising. However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughout the film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wear away on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.
Nonetheless, the film has some delightfully entertaining and hilarious portions, though overall it leaves much to be desired. The ending drags out painfully and becomes torturingly corny, nothing that is unpredictable about it. In spite of the ups and downs that one has when watching the film, it can still be called a decent film. There was some very good exercise of comedy and admittedly it is superior to many of the films that have come out, but if you were hoping for anything more than just a slightly entertaining film, you will be disappointed. Aside from the minimal comedy to keep you interested nothing more is offered by the story.The movie should make you laugh, and the movie is worth seeing, but again, it is far less than the Christmas classic that people are claiming.","

","Will Ferrell stars in this Christmas comedy known as Elf. Buddy lives his whole life as a misfit Elf helping out Santa in the North Pole. One day Buddy, who is taller and clumsier then the other Elves, realizes he is not a real Elf and decides to go out and search for his real dad. Only knowing how his life was back at the North Pole it was a huge change in his life when Buddy traveled to the big city of New York. His journey is conveyed by hilarious humor when Papa Elf has to explain to Buddy that the, ""yellow snow was not for eating and the gum under the railings was not free candy."" This movie contains comedy and romance and is good for all ages! I give this movie 10 stars because it is trying to show the loving relationship between Buddy and his father. The movie was successful in trying to bring out the kid in everyone by using jokes that are funny no matter how old you are. Hidden beneath all of the comedy was a lesson in which although someone like Buddy may be unique, they still can fit in and belong somewhere in the world.Will Ferrell is absolutely very funny in this movie. The way he can act like a kid is phenomenal. No other actor could have made Buddy the Elf come to life and walk us through his journey as a misfit, sheltered Elf at the North Pole, through his many adventures searching for his dad in in the big city. With Will Ferrell's other movies such as Step Brothers and Talladega Nights, his role in Elf is a different side of him most people have never seen. In this movie he falls in love and develops a relationship with his brother that is unlike any other. Being 30 years old and dressing in an elf costume everywhere he goes is only a little part of this movie that makes it so funny. Being used to wearing his outfit around the North Pole, it was hard for Buddy to understand that his costume was not appropriate for the work life.I recommend seeing it with children because they will not stop laughing. Buddy, ""traveled through the candy cane forest"" This is just some of what he says to capture everyone's imagination. Not only is the movie extremely funny but it is the perfect movie for the holiday time. I enjoyed this movie with my family because in the movie the actors develop multiple relationships. This can show people that someone can replenish a relationship that was once lost. To me this movie is trying to convey to the audience that with all of this comedy, there is something deeper. Buddy is trying to build a relationship with his father and get to know his brother. Along the way of finding this, he stumbles across a woman in the department store where she is one of ""Santa's helpers,"" who he falls in love with. His weird role is enhanced when he does not know how to ask her out on a date.This movie is worth seeing. An adventure, a love story and Santa Clause all mixed together in a delightful holiday treat. Will Ferrell helps make this a movie that is sure to be enjoyed with you family each Christmas.","

Hobbs, on Santa's naughty list for being heartless, had no idea that Buddy was even born. Buddy, meanwhile, experiences the delights of New York City as only an elf can. When Walter's relationship with Buddy interferes with his job, he is forced to reevaluate his priorities......Elf isn't as clever as it thinks it is, but it shouldn't be this good either.Ferrall has never been better as the titular character, and it's due to his child like prowess and body language. It's a shame he's never really hit this high in a long time, as he is really likable in this, and makes this movie a little more magical.The rest of the cast are fine, but this is Ferralls movie all over the shop, and there is hardly a scene where he's not in it.It gets a little soppy at the end, but it's a Christmas movie, so all is forgiven.Funny and touching, if a little too blunt with its message.","

","A Wonderful Movie For All Ages""Elf"" is one of the best holiday movies I have ever seen. It is a hilarious comedy that is great for all ages. The director Jon Favreau did a fantastic job with the plot line, comedy, and casting the roles for this movie. Buddy the elf played by Will Ferrell is really who makes this movie though.For example this movie is about a baby orphan named Buddy(Will Ferrell) who finds his way into Santa's sack on Christmas Eve and is then raised as and elf in the North Pole. As Buddy (Will Ferrel) grows up he realizes he is different from the other elves and Santa finally thinks he is old enough to know he is not an elf and that his real dad lives in New York City. Buddy ( Will Ferrell) then goes on a quest to find his father (James Caan) who does not know he exists, but his elf like qualities don't exactly fit in in New York City. This movie is a great holiday movie with a fun plot line.In addition, to a good plot line this movie also has hilarious comedy. On Buddy's journey to find his dad he is oblivious to everything going on around him. He has this cheerful enthusiastic attitude every where he goes and it makes this movie hilarious and an amazing experience to watch.Although many people may think this is not one of Will Ferrel's best performances, this might be because they are used to his usual roles in more adult type movies. Elf is a great movie for all ages and is especially good for families. When you watch it you can just feel the Christmas spirit surrounding you.Furthermore, I believe the actors that were casted in this movie had the perfect personalities for their roles. They all did a outstanding job and they are what make this movie so good. All of them put a lot of effort into their roles and play them very well.In conclusion, this movie is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies and will be shown on TV for the rest of our lives. I also believe it will become a classic that our kids will watch in the future. This is a need to see Christmas movie.","

","""Elf"" is a pretty cute film--but they're starting to overplay it a bit. Just this Christmas season, it's been on TV 1483857 times (give or take 2). And I worry that being shown so much that folks might have a backlash--might start to hate the film even though it's decent family entertainment and is worth your time.Will Ferrell stars as 'Buddy'--a STRANGE young man indeed. Apparently, as a baby he was accidentally kidnapped and brought back to the North Pole by Santa. Not knowing what to do with the boy so he gave him to an elf (Bob Newhart) to raise as his own. However, he's a terrible elf. Part of it that he's absolutely too big to live as an elf--and part of it is that he's a bit...well....stupid. Eventually, after not fitting in for a very long time, the elves inform Buddy that they now know who his read father is and Buddy leaves the Pole for New York City to find his dad. Once there, Buddy once again does NOT fit in--and makes a mess of most everything. Can Buddy sort all this out and connect with his dad or will the audience leave the theater feeling depressed and miserable (yeah, right!).The film has many funny moments (my favorite was when he exposed FAKE Santa to the kids waiting to see him), a few sweet ones and some very clichéd ones--but I can forgive this, as it IS a family comedy and I am not expecting Shakespeare! Well worth seeing....and a bit odd seeing Ed Asner playing Santa!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2524521/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2524521,7," Will Ferrell completely steals every scene
","Although it stands on its own, without the man, as an old-fashioned festive comedy with a good heart, Will Ferrell still completely steals every scene. He completely carries Elf, giving a charming performance with one foot in the spirit of Christmas and the other in cruel reality.He plays a human named Buddy who is accidentally brought back by Santa (Edward Asner, better known as Carl Fredrickson in the Pixar film Up) from an adoption centre one Christmas. He is then raised by Bob Newhart as a Christmas elf, from childhood until adulthood. Though naturally, being a human means Buddy can stand out from the crowd a teensy bit.When Buddy discovers he is a human, he sets out to Manhattan to find his natural father (James Caan). Things don't go too well when Caan turns out to be a bit of an arsehole. And from then on it's a father-son story, with a love interest thrown in for good measure and the natural Christmas spirit sprinkled on like sugar through-out.But unless you're 6 or younger, you'll probably notice that the story doesn't really matter. As stated before, it's all Will Ferrell's movie, and he welcomely never stops chewing the scenery. He's terrifically funny while also never forgetting he's in a Christmas movie. What's great is that we all can tell Ferrell is aware his character is ignorant of the cruel reality of present-day Manhattan (which sets up some very funny routines), and he does the very best he can with the material, in a truly hilarious performance.As for the other actors, they do their job. None of them really shine, but they all give satisfactory performances, and every one of them generously lets Ferrell steal each scene he's in. The scenes without Ferrell are rather tedious at times (particularly the scenes with Caan working in his office, which are likely to make children fast-forward to Buddy 's next scene), but they keep the story moving along.The only major complaint is the ending, which for me is far too cheesy. Apart from one amusing send-up of the Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot film, there are barely any jokes in the third act. It's the bit which revolves around ""pure Christmas spirit"", and this would have been absolutely fine with me if it wasn't such a sudden change of tone for the film. Going from funny comedy to sugary Christmas schmaltz in the space of two minutes is, for me, a bit of a letdown, but the Christmassy feeling is there so it's not a massive complaint.Overall, Elf is a delightful seasonal comedy which has the Christmas spirit while also benefiting greatly from Ferrell's very funny performance. It may not be brilliant, but with its golden-oldies soundtrack and all-around festive feel, I hope it'll be recognised as a holiday classic in decades to come.","

","As a baby, Buddy {Will Ferrell} crept out of his crib in the orphanage right into Santa's goody bag. Thus he grows up at the North Pole working with the elves in Santa's work shop. Now firmly grown up physically, Buddy is shocked to learn that he is a human being, not an elf. So upon hearing that his father lives in New York, he sets off to find him. But can he survive New York? More to the point, can New York survive Buddy?Like him or loathe him, Will Ferrell has a nice line in physical comedy. So with that, Elf is the perfect vehicle to showcase his exuberance. But with that also comes the problem with the film. For it feels {actually it is} like director John Favreau and writer David Berenbaum have plopped Ferrell into a fish out of water scenario and stitched together a number of sketches for him to run thru. The outcome of which may induce some amiable comedy along the way, but renders the finale a weak attempt at holiday message emotion. The supporting cast also suffer in the wake of Ferrell's domination. Something that annoys when you consider we have the likes of James Caan and Mary Steenburgen trying to breathe on the sidelines.There's enough here to make it a safe holiday viewing for the kids and those adults who have a penchant for Ferrell's comedy. But really it's a patchwork quilt of a picture, with the makers playing it all too by the numbers just to sell tickets. 5/10","

","I never had the urge to watch Elf. I saw the adverts, thought it an over-americanised piece of tacky, vulgar crap. So when my music teacher decided she was going to make us watch it, I wasn't looking forward to it. The fact she claimed to have watched it 6 times since buying it, before I saw it, was worrying, and the fact she wanted to show it to her GCSE music class was just as odd. But she had bought us chocolate logs (there are only 10 people who take music) so we all settled down to watch it (""if anyone asks, we're studying film music!"").And wow. I mean wow. This film was one of the funniest and most touching films (considering what I thought it would be) that I'd ever seen. There are so many scenes that made me laugh out loud to count. And I can truthfully say that at certain points at the end, our entire class went ""awww!"" (the fact that we're all girls shouldn't factor into this.) The advert for this film doesn't do it justice at all. There's a plenty of humour in it to satisfy any adult (or 16-year old) as well as the kiddie laughs.Will Ferral makes this film what it is. His child-in-a-grown-mans performance is admirable and everyone said that they would marry him just for his sweetness in this film. That said, Zooey Deschanels snarling attitude definitely brought a satisfying ring to the film, with her witty put downs of Buddy the Elf and her portrayal of 'teen angst' is fantastic.Watch this. Recommend is not a strong enough word for how much I want people to watch it! Just watch it, OK?","

Somewhere amid the crazy antics and situations there is a Christmas message or two. But this film is something to enjoy just for the laughs. Most of the humor comes from an overgrown elf trying to adapt and learn how to live in an adult world. Along the way, he spreads some Christmas joy. Will Ferrell is Buddy – an overgrown elf by mistake, whose doings resemble the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and Merwin's magic. It's hard to imagine anyone else giving the performance Ferrell gives here. The role seems written for him. Bob Newhart is Papa Elf. I don't know any other comedian who could get people to laugh so much with a straight face. He applies his trademark as well in ""Elf."" Edward Asner is Santa Claus, and James Caan is Buddy's real father, Walter. A host of younger actors do very well in their supporting roles. This is a fun movie that most should enjoy for the silliness and laughter.","

","A great excuse for Will Ferrell to run around in holiday garb, drawing sidelong glances from the sidewalk-strollers of Manhattan. Ferrell is the ultimate man-child, a six-and-a-half foot mess of arms and legs in green tights, buckled shoes and a pointy hat, matching the elvish wardrobe of 1964's Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. As physical comedy and ridiculous enthusiasm is his forte, Elf makes for an excellent vehicle, but it's also loaded with a swath of supporting talent (admittedly, another of the comedian's calling cards). Zooey Deschanel (somewhat unrecognizable in blonde hair) is a good fit as his skeptical, frayed love interest, but the best work comes from James Caan, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gass and especially Bob Newhart as his sweet, yet long-suffering, adoptive father on the North Pole. Genuinely funny, warm, sugary and spirited; an unexpectedly effective successor to the Christmas classics it seemingly sets out to roast. Worth adding to the annual rotation.","

Although i have to say some moments are a little bit too much for kids maybe a PG-13 rating would be much better and like i said even tho Will Ferrell is an unfunny and untalented actor he owns the role in every step of the way as a silly guy who thinks he is an elf and James Caan is also a great underrated actor who plays his father and judges him most of the time. At the end Elf is a great movie and the 6.9 rating i think is a little bit low and it's definitely a great Christmas Movie.,"

Pretty darn funny in some spots, warm in others and the suspension of disbelief is fairly easy for the most part. (I mean, exceptHe's still human, right? Wouldn't he freeze in that outfit?

And every once in a while, it's nice to have something that's both great for kids, but also enjoyable to adultswithout being a Pixar animated movie. ***Final thoughts: You may have been right about the half star, Chris, but forgot about the four full ones before it.

","Jon Favreau's Elf is as snappy as holiday comedies come, mainly thanks to Will Ferrell's pretty damn hilarious performance as Buddy, a human baby stranded in the north pole and raised by pint sized elves as one of their own. Ferrell can be overbearing at times with his often hard to swallow brand of abrasive humour, but there's always moments where he reigns it in, sticks to the script and gives us magic. I think that this being a family film dictates that he especially needs to play it close to the chest and gives him a comedic track to run on without derailing into the desperate realm of cringy improv and sticking to the screenplay's wonderful jist, and not smothering it in ego and comedic decadence. It's a wonderfully sweet script as well, seeing Buddy travel from the north pole to bustling Manhatten to locate his long lost human family. His cranky birth father (craggy, immortalized James Caan) wallows in lukewarm disbelief as Buddy follows him everywhere, including back home to spend time with bis wife (Mary Steenburgen) and kids. He sorta kinda finds work in a mall due to his inherent elf-ness and gets himself into all kinds of trouble, until he catches the eye of a hired elf played by adorable Zooey Deschanel, who's got herself a case of the Christmas blues. Ferrell's upbeat, manic tone combined with Zooey's dry, laconic yet amused personality makes for perfect chemistry, especially in their odd, compelling rendition of 'Baby its cold outside'. Buddy blunders his way from one austere NYC situation to the next with shiny naivety and blind, trusting optimism to hysterical payoff, a dynamic which sits at the core of what's made the film so successful over the years. The only bad note for me is a terrifying animated version of the north pole that looks like Wallace and Gromit got drunk on rum and eggnog and dreamt some creepy version of Santa's homestead, complete with eerie talking seals. Director Favreau participates in a cameo as Caan's family doctor, Edward Asner shows up as a jolly enough Santa, and Bob Newhart steals many laughs as Buddy's awkward surrogate elf father.","

","Clearly some contributors to IMDb have no sense of fun or Christmas. This is a harmless film, aimed mainly at kids, which is an easy watch at Christmas. 135,000 average almost 7 out of 10 with their opinions on this site, so who are these few humourless people who feel they can criticize so freely. It may not be Hamlet but it has many saving graces and clearly appeals to the majority who watch it.Jamess Caan's role is a million miles from his role in The Godfather, where he met with a very bloody end. Will Ferrell built a reputation on this film so it had a positive effect.Bob Newhart took a break from running the Driving School and Ed Asner is also prominent.The film received positive reviews from critics and it earned $220.4 million world wide on a $33 million budget. That is a whole lot more people who cannot be wrong. Happy Christmas!Reach for the channel tuner if it's not your cup of tea but many more feel this movie is an integral part of the Christmas holidays. Happy Christmas!","

","How this movie is ""only"" rated 6.9 is a mystery to me. Everybody I know young and old, who has ever seen it fell in love with it. For me personally, Elf is up there with Miracle on 34th Street and It's A Wonderful Life- not just a great Christmas movie but one of the eat family movies you'll ever see. Will Ferrell is hot and cold when it comes to his film work. I've enjoyed maybe half of his movies, but the other half are unfunny duds. (Bewitched, Kicking and Screaming, and Semi-Pro come to mind.). Elf is probably his very best work ever- and also just happens to be his most innocent, childlike character. The supporting cast is wonderful, too. James Caan is a great, grumpy comic foil, and Bob Newhart is perfect, as always.","

","The elf is a Christmas film made in 2003. THe movie is something that can be watched by the whole family. the story is about a human raised in the norht pole who thinks he is an elf.However when he finds out he was adopted he leaves the north pole and travels through new york city to find his father. Buddy the elf (will Ferrell) fully embraces the role and is hilarious as he runs around the city making new friends and eating very weird things, like gum off the street and syrup spaghetti. The movie is also very original for a Christmas movie. Its like no other Christmas movie i have ever seen. In conclusion the elf is such a great movie and has won 2 awards and been nominated for 7 because of is great acting, originality, and comedy. This is why i have given the film a 10 out of 10.","

",Elf seems to have become a Christmas Classic over the years. The kind of film kids want to see each December along with Home Alone.The premise is rather silly. Will Ferrell is an infant adopted in the North Pole and wrongly thinks he is an elf despite being much taller than the other elves.The naive Ferrell decides to go to New York in search of his real father once he finds out the truth. Dad happens to be the more cynical James Caan who is rather taken aback by a long lost son who thinks he is an elf and maybe borderline retarded.Ferrell gets a job helping out at Santa's grotto in a department store whilst trying to connect with his father and help the real Santa by getting the public some real Christmas spirit to make his sleigh soar.The film is both silly and charming. Kids will love it but adults may find it a little bit over the top. Ferrell has enough charm to pull off the role. James Caan on the other hand has found a new generation of fans who know him as Walter and not Sonny Corleone.,"

","I saw it last night at a Christmas party and found it enjoyable. But despite its Christmas theme, it was really intended to entertain adults rather than children.There was no profanity, graphic violence, and sexuality was limited to seeing the head and shoulders of a woman in the shower. But much of the humor would fly against most children's' heads. The basic story is about a human baby in an orphanage who crawled into Santa Claus's toy sack and ends up at the North Pole, being raised by an elf there. Buddy, as he is named, does not fit in as he is a giant compared to the elves, and Santa allows him to go to New York City to meet his biological father-who happens to be on Santa's naughty list for being too devoted to his career to pay attention to his family. Buddy meets his father, who disbelieves him at first, and he goes to the Gimbel's department store where he is mistaken as an employee and is put to work. Buddy inadvertently causes trouble there, and when he reunites with his father who finally discovers that Buddy was the son he never knew existed, he inadvertently brings trouble to his new family too.The movie is based on the ""fish out of water"" trope, and Buddy is naive but not necessarily stupid. The ending is happy if predictable, and it works as adult Christmas entertainment. The actors work well in their respective parts too and Ed Asner makes a surprisingly effective Santa. Recommended, but really for the grown-ups.","

","Elf, a movie directed by Jon Favreau features Buddy The Elf (Will Ferrel) as a human who was adopted by Santa Clause and his Elves at birth. His massive size has always hindered his elf-like talents but he is accepted by them none the less. When Buddy learns of his biological father (James Caan) being on the Naughty List, he is sent to New York city on his quest to regain his father's compassion. The film plot and storyline are somewhat predictable, but in an endearing way. Ferrell does a great job of really taking on a character with a ton of different quirks that a lot of actors would not take on as well as he did. His love interest in the movie, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) is somewhat of a weak point acting-wise in the cinematic adventure. Her monotone voice does little for the vibrant aura of the surrounding actors and she has little to no relevance to the plot or events that take place during Buddy's antics. Overall, the movie is a great family film but also is a movie that is great for all ages. It has elements that appeal to a large variety of demographics and is slowly becoming a holiday classic that can be viewed on television multiple times during the season. OVERALL RATING: 8.5/10","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2716093/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2716093,7," It's An Enjoyable Christmas Fantasy
","I'm not the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, but in casting ""Elf"" someone had a brainstorm, because I have to admit that Ferrell was absolutely perfect in this role. He plays ""Buddy the Elf,"" a human baby in an orphanage who accidentally hitches a ride in Santa's toy bag one Christmas Eve and finds himself at the North Pole, adopted by ""Papa Elf"" (Bob Newhart) who raises him as an elf. Of course, it isn't a good ""fit,"" so to speak. As a human, Buddy is a lot bigger than your average elf and, finally realizing he's human, he sets out for New York City (with no knowledge of the world outside the North Pole) and sets out to find his father, who he's been told is Walter Hobbs (James Caan) - a big publishing executive working at the Empire State Building. Essentially, the story is about Buddy trying to fit into life in the real world, and to be honest, it's really quite enjoyable and sometimes even quite funny.The cast all do quite well with their parts, although I thought that we didn't really need a love angle for Buddy, represented by Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) - who's adorably cute, but I'm not sure she was essential to the story. Every movie of this type, of course, needs a scrooge-type character to be reformed and filled with the Christmas spirit. Here, that was supposed to be Walter, but I honestly didn't find Walter to be scrooge-like enough. He seemed to be a basically nice guy who was himself just being overworked by an overbearing boss (in a limited role played by Michael Lerner.) I didn't get the jarring ""turnaround"" in Walter's attitude that you often get from this. He seemed to accept Buddy too easily - with a bit of encouragement from his wife (Mary Steenburgen.) Still, while some of the characters didn't hit home as powerfully as they could have, the performances were good and they added up to a fun story.It was nice to see Ed Asner play a fairly important role as Santa in this, and the movie even managed to pay just a wee bit of homage to the TV special Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer, as Leon the Snowman who slid around at the North Pole looked basically like the sliding snowman who slid around and narrated Rudolf (although the narration for this movie, when necessary, was done by Papa Elf.) The animals in the woods at the North Pole also reminded me of the animals in Rudolf.It's a cute story, good fun for the family in the Christmas season. (7/10)","

","Anybody who knows me knows I'm hard on Will Ferrell. However, after seeing this movie I have Ferrell fever! Ferrell proved himself worthy of the comedic giant status he has earned by portraying the naive over-sized ""Elf (human)"" named Buddy, a human adopted by an elf who is raised in the North Pole and somewhat reeks havoc on the elf community with just his sheer size. After having a talk with his father, he embarks on the mission of a lifetime to find out who Buddy the Elf truly is! Being fueled with nothing but sugar and a pure adrenaline rush, Buddy ends up lost in the big apple, unintentionally reeking havoc along the way, finding someone who graciously opens his home to Buddy only to have the door slammed right in his sweet little elf face after good intentions turn into bad reality. Along the adventure he proves to every stuffed shirt stuck up businessman the true Christmas spirit lies within your heart, and Santa Clause really does exist and is fueled by the pure joy of Christmas. This movie has become a staple in our yearly Christmas line up. Kudos to Ferrell for making a family friendly comedy unlike some of the other great actors that have come from SNL.","

","Elf has the premise and the look of a badly made Christmas special made solely for network TV. Going into this with mediocre expectations, it only took about ten minutes of seeing Will Ferrell in an elf costume to know that my predictions were dreadfully wrong. This wasn't a case of holiday dreck, but a case of the Christmas film that combined heart, soul, wit, and laughs into a beautiful holiday parable.The story is about Buddy the Elf (Ferrell) who accidentally crawled into Santa's sack at the orphanage when he was an infant and gets taken back to the North Pole. Santa Claus and the elves choose to raise him and train him to become an elf. Buddy is of course a human so he grows a lot faster than the average elf. In fact, he towers over every other elf he works with, and this leads to problems when he is older.Buddy then learns he is a human, which causes confusion and sadness. It is told that he was placed in that orphanage as an infant because his father fell in love with a woman who gave birth to him then gave him up unbeknownst to him. Buddy then decides he will go to New York City to try and find his dad and reconnect with him.His goal is to also spread Christmas cheer far and wide because Santa's sleigh is almost forced to operate with an engine. In the olden days, Santa's sleigh could fly because of mass amounts of Christmas spirit and children believing in Santa Claus. Now, he has to resort to heavy machinery to do that job.Will Ferrell hasn't sat right with me for the longest time, but as I see more of his movies I begin to like the guy in a sense where I'd like to see him do one of two movies; (a) heartfelt children's' films or (2) very serious dramas in the vein of his 2011 film Everything Must Go. He doesn't have the talents to pull off incredibly funny slapstick because his schtick is usually composed of running around like a towering dork or just screaming. Elf shows his ability to incorporate his persona in a character you can't help but love.We also see Zooey Deschannel, one of my favorite females in the business today, as Jovie, a woman who works at a mall as Santa's little helpers. Buddy falls for Jovie in a sort of non-conventional way, but he winds up getting conventional help from his younger brother Michael (Tay).Elf is more than holiday fluff, it's a successful romp of Christmas spirit sealed inside a good family film. The cast is lively, the antics aren't over the top, and the storyline unique and film sustainable. This also shows immensely that director Jon Favreau can be handed a script for a thriller, a comedy, a romantic comedy, a superhero film, or a drama and still be able to create on screen magic. I'm also sure this beats a movie about elves working in a tree during the dry season.Starring: Will Ferrell, James Cann, Zooey Deschannel, and Daniel Tay. Directed by: Jon Favreau.","

","I actually was not all that remiss to seeing this, Jon Favreau is one of my favorite filmmakers working in Hollywood today. Zathura is Where the Wild Things Are without the cerebralness or Karen O, I am of the camp that considers Iron Man and its sequel to be both living up to and counterbalancing Nolan's machismo brooding tale of The Dark Knight, Cowboys vs. Aliens promises to be geeky fanboy action in CGI awesomeness about in a blender with some actual plot and characters.I find Will Ferrell insufferable when he yells.Will Ferrell is like Jim Carrey. People like him mugging, mocking, yelling, contorting his face, and generally just being a big child, when homeboy could actually continue to keep making awesome stuff like Stranger than Fiction (or in Carrey's case, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind). For whatever reason, actually having a character is animus to an audience that just wants a clown banging his head against a wall. I'm sorry, Will Ferrell. You deserve better than that.So anyway, this movie is a modern classic for the Yuletide Time and for what it's worth, I can definitely see why. Buddy's absolute belief in Christmas cheer and his grinning dedication to spreading it is infectious, in its own way. It helps that the cynicism of the other characters actually works out sensibly. The movie still has to have its regrettable prolonged burp jokes, but it's nice to see things like random-taxi-hits-lead turn into actual character development as Buddy progressively gets a handle of this strange New York reality world he's found himself in and starts to adapt to its landscape... but all without losing his spiritedness. I can get behind that.Could be better. It did feel like just a few scenes were missing in the love subplot between Buddy and Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).What won me over in this movie was the North Pole land and the CGI references to old stop-motion animation Christmas movies of the past. Leon the Snowman is where it's at. Also, not only is Peter Dinklage an underrated actor, but his work in this movie shows he could do some really remarkable stuff if we'd all get over the ""But it's funny 'cause he's a little person"" aspect of it. Compare his role here (oh so woefully, woefully short, oh so scene-stealing) to his work in The Station Agent and then his work in Death at a Funeral (the, uh, British one, not the redundant and confusingly way too soon after remade one) and this man has a gift.So what the hey, seal of approval for this one. Going back to Favreau, I can't emphasize enough he knows how to keep a movie moving and never outstays his welcome, Elf moves at a brisk pace and is over before you know it, whether you like it or not. Now that audiences are actually getting comfortable watching giant robot movies for two and a half hours or more, the art of moving along, one of Hollywood's major entertainment assets, sometimes feels like it's getting lost.--PolarisDiB","

","Elf is the story of a human named Buddy who was raised by elves in the North Pole at Santa's Workshop. When Buddy becomes an adult, he is told that he was adopted so he goes on a quest to find his father in New York City.This movie is hilarious. Will Ferrell is perfect for the role of buddy! He really portrays the character's sweetness with a comedic touch. One of the reasons I love this film so much is that it really captures what it would be like to take someone who has lived in fantasy land and throw them into the hustle and bustle of the big city. There are several montages throughout the film. My favorite would have to be when Buddy comes to New York for the first time because he does such bizarre things. If I were to see him eating the gum of the hand rail or playing in a revolving door in my town, I would think he was crazy! I end up feeling bad for Buddy because he is so clueless to how the real world works.Another thing that makes this movie so hysterical is that in the North Pole the props, costumes, sets and back drop are so elementary and simple, it really accentuates the innocence and comical quality of the elf world. Also, in the North Pole, there are some animals made of clay animation. Their design is very similar to the old Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer movie, and that warms my heart and makes me laugh.This movie is perfect for family night, watching with friends or when you just need a laugh. This story is touching yet funny as Buddy goes on an amazing journey to get closer to his father's heart and bring back holiday spirit to all. This is a great film for all ages because it contains the fun innocence of an elf that children can enjoy and it also has a bit of adult humor for the older viewers. Although young children will love this movie, I think ages 7 and younger should watch this with an adult or older child because they may get slightly confused or frightened. Over all, this is a wonderful film, whether it's the holidays or not.Reviewed by Raven Devanney, age 13, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic","

","With Christmas just having finished,I've decided to take a little bit of a break from watching two of my favourite Christmas films (Bob Clarks definitive Xmas film-A Christmas Story and the surprisingly strong Muppets Christmas Carol.)and to try out something that I had been looking forward to seeing for the last few weeks.With a surprisingly strong cast,a charming screenplay and a huge dollop of charm,the movie is something that can easily keep kids and adults very entertained over the holiday period.The plot: When Santa returns to his factory, from having dropped off all the presents.He makes a shocking discovery,that a baby has gotten into one of the sacks.Santa decides that the best thing to do is to let one of his chief elf's-Papa Elf raise the baby(whose named Buddy).Due to being raised by elves, overtime Buddy starts to believe that he really is an elf.Sadly one day at the factory,Buddy hears some of the other elves saying that they can not believe,that he does not realise that he is a human!After hearing this,he tells Papa Elf that he wants to go and meet his real father(who does not know that Buddy has even been born).After hearing all of this,Buddy becomes very determined to give his dad the best Christmas ever.Though due to his dad now being too stuck into his job,Buddy has a huge mountain to climb,to get his dad to join in the spirit of Christmas. View on the film:Though the scenes where Will Ferrall is stuffing his face full of sweets,made me cringe (and not in the way that the film makers were hoping for)due to how forced the joke felt.Surprisingly,Ferrall makes Buddy stand out from all of his other fantastic characters,by removing any sense that Buddy has a very inflated-ego.and replacing it with a very natural sweet (though not sugar-coated) personality.Ferrall is given huge support,by a shining performance from Zooey Deschanel as the wonderfully punk style Jovie.Deschanel impressively shows Jovie going from being very agitated,to finding Buddy completely irresistible in a very enjoyable way.Whilst the screenplay by David Berenbaum,could be seen as a very broad up date of A Christmas Carol (with Buddys dad having to learn the true meaning of Christmas)Berenbaum thankfully,gives most of the traditional Xmas set pieces for films,a fun modern trust (such as having the elves make modern plastic toys)Smartly David makes sure that the story is always the heart of the film,and that you are always following Buddy,and hoping to see his dad accept him for what he is...Final view on the film:A great film for the whole fame,with a stunning cast and a heart-warming story.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1951549/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1951549,6," Will Ferrell is my favorite 'Elf'!
","'Elf' is probably one of my favorite Christmas films for its funny and sweet and original and did I mention funny yet? I love Will Ferrell and so maybe I'm a bit bias when giving this such a high rating, but I can't help it. I watch this movie quite a bit and every time I'm reminded of why I love it. The story is about a young orphan who ends up a stow-away one Christmas when he slips out of his crib and slips into Santa's big bag of toys. When Santa finds out he has a new guest he leaves baby duty up to one of the older elves (Bob Newhart) who never found love and thus never was able to have the children he wanted so badly. When Buddy (Ferrell) gets older though he soon realizes he's not like the other elves and this sends him on a journey to find his real parents. This journey leads him to Walter (James Caan), his father, a man who horrifically lands on Santa's 'bad list' year after year. The fact that Santa is all but not believed in make it difficult for anyone, including his own father, to believe Buddy, but the viewer is moved to love him more and more with each passing frame. This is a perfect role for Will, allowing him to tone down his over the top antics (I love those too) and give us a more family friendly performance that's as funny as it is charming. As Buddy strives to gain his fathers love and affection he must also try and resurrect the Christmas Spirit that so many have lost. With great supporting performances by Zooey Deshanel and Mary Steenburgen, 'Elf' is a delightful holiday film that is sure to please the whole family!","

","Will Farrell has done better films than this one but this is a warm feel good holiday film. When you look at it as a whole film, it holds a certain charm. That charm is established by framing the story around belief in the fantasy known as Christmas.This is the most extensive work done by Bob Newhart since the 1990's. Bob is the framework that holds this story together. Ed Asner has a very small role as Santa & is just here enough to be recognizable having little chance to do much acting.Brunette bomb shell Zooey Deschannel is charming as a blonde & proves she can sing. Hopefully she will get some better roles as her young career has proved she can handle them. In this movie, she makes the viewer buy that young innocent charm as she glows here.Faizon Love is excellent in support as the Gimbles store manager. James Caan is OK here, less annoying than in some films, but for some reason he does not seem to get really good roles anymore.There are some gross holiday bits, like downing a 2 liter Coke & a 5 minute belch which is entirely logical, and then some bits which are funny physical comedy. Farrell does not carry the whole show here and that is a good thing. While he is considered the star of his films, his films are better when the support can carry them. His easily worst film is Bewitched where he tried to carry the entire film & flopped badly.This doesn't measure up to classic holiday films but is better than some of the lame efforts of recent years.","

","You may expect this film to be a little on the kiddie side, but in fact it it is a great family comedy with jokes for all ages. The story is told by Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who tells the story of his son. Basically Santa (Edward Asner) was delivering at an orphanage, and a baby managed to get out his crib and crawl into Santa's sack (to get a toy), and he was brought to the North Pole. Papa raised this boy, he named Buddy, as his own, and as he grew he learnt the elf world as if he was one. But it is after he overhears that he is human that Buddy (Will Ferrell) decides he should find his real family. Papa gives him a photo he has kept of his birth father, Walter (James Caan), who deals with book publishing, and is unfortunately on the naughty list. So Buddy sets off to New York, and with his childlike innocence discovers all the wonders of the city. When he does meet Walter, he does not believe he is his son, or in Santa, so till he can get to him again, Buddy stays in the near toy store, where he meets his beautiful love interest, Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). The second time he meets his Dad, Buddy is confirmed from DNA results of his biology, and Walter does eventually let him come home with him to meet wife Emily (Back to the Future Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and son Michael (Daniel Tay). Walter does try to make Buddy more normal by taking him to work, and giving him normal clothes, but his childish behaviour still causes chaos, especially when the employees are talking to short children's book writer Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage), who Buddy keeps calling Elf. Walter loses his patience and sends Buddy away, but when Santa crashes in the middle of central park because he has run low on Christmas spirit to power the sleigh, everyone shows they believe by singing along with Jovie to help, even Scrooge-like Walter. The highlights for me are all of Ferrell, but more especially the snowball fight and the large burp after drinking a whole bottle of Coca Cola in seconds. Good!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1775304/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1775304,6," better than most of Ferrel's films
","I'll start by saying I can't personally stand Will Ferrel and usually don't like his movies. I don't find him funny and I don't normally find any humour or anything to laugh at in his films.This is a rare exception. It's a Christmas movie and I'm reviewing it having seen it on TV at the weekend.This movie is in the same kind of genre as Dudley Moore's ""The Santa Clause Movie"" and Tim Allen's ""The Santa Clause"". Ferrel plays Buddy, a baby who crawls into Santa's sack one year when he's delivering gifts to an orphanage. Sadly the film derails itself right there as a baby manages to open a locked cot and fall safely from 2 feet up without making a sound.Ignoring that (and we must, unfortunately) the baby is only discovered when Santa returns to the North Pole workshop and is adopted and raised as an Elf. Eventually he discovers he is human and sets off to discover his real father (James Caan, not suited to comedy or kids films which this is really).The film follows Buddy as he tries to fit into Human culture and how badly he is suited to that task having been raised in the Elf culture. The film is decent enough and is greatly improved by Buddy's love interest Zooey Deschanel (who I only knew from the Hitch Hikers Move and had the feeling that Reese Witherspoon turned this role down).She looks great and plays her role well enough. James Caan has some good moments but really isn't suited to this type of movie.The locations and sets are very good, there's a small appearance from KG (of Tenacious D fame) as a creative writer and the role of Caan's wife (Mary Steenburgen) could have been cast a lot better as she really isn't suited to this type of film either so both her and James Caan were very badly miscast.The film is mildly bearable with the brain disengaged, even Ferrel manages to not annoy for a change.OK for kids.","

","Stars: Will Ferrell, James Caan, Ed Asner, Zooey Dechanel, Bob Newhart, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter, Kyle Gaas, Artie Lange.Let me start by saying that I thought all the performances in this film were good. Will Ferrell was good, James Caan kept the movie afloat, Bob Newhart was a great presence. With such a great cast, I'm amazed they made such a mediocre film. The character of buddy the elf is kind of a one note joke, ""fish out of water"" character that really has no development in the film. Buddy is a human, who was raised as an elf, that goes back to New York to visit his birth father who never knew he was born. In New York he acts like an idiot, getting hit by cars and eating gum off the bottom of benches, etc. Buddy meets a girl played by Zooey Dechanel, who has a problem singing in public. I guess this movie is good for kids, but I found it to be very stupid. I thought Bob Newhart's narration (through the beginning and at the end) was a nice touch.My rating: C. 94 mins. PG for crude humor and mild language","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1524138/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1524138,10," A cute Christmas movie
","This movie came out when I was young, nine or so, and I remember giggling and laughing through this film. C'mon, it was cute, I loved it and still do. But, this is just my personal opinion. I'll give an overview of the movie.The Plot: The overall plot was...cute. Nothing amazing, just a typical Christmas tale. It tells the story of a young man who was raised by elves, and once finding out who he 'truly is', a human, sets out on a journey to meet his real family. And, before he sets out, Santa gives him horrible news. His father is on the naughty list. Buddy greets this by yelling 'NO!!!' as loudly as he can. Finally, he sets off to New York to find his dad, and meet his brother, a little boy played by the adorable Daniel Tay, and his father's new wife. Overall, it's a sweet plot with a sweet ending. No miracle, but it's cute.The Jokes: If you're looking for jokes that you'd find on Comedy Central, then don't both with this movie. But if you're looking for primarily kid-appropriate, Nickelodeon-like jokes, then look no further. This is the movie for you. Children from about five/sixish to eleven should enjoy this movie, along with a handful of preteens/teenagers (such as myself).The Acting: Okay, the acting's not great. It's adequate at the most. Will Ferrell plays his regular yell-out-lines role, though his facial features and comedic timing are pretty good. Zooey Deschanel's good, not perfect, but good. She definitely evens out the movie without trying to overuse comedy or burst out in exaggerated lines like a certain actor in this movie who was mentioned earlier. James Caan was probably the best in this movie. No, his performance wasn't Oscar-worthy, but it was better than the majority of the performances. He believably plays a spiritless man who's in denial of having Buddy as a son, and never really trails out of character. Finally, Daniel Tay, who plays Buddy's brother and, as we see later in the movie, good friend, is absolutely adorable in his snow hat. His acting's pretty good, not perfect, it was just a regular child performance. However, his performance is pretty much brushed aside because he's overshadowed by his adult co-stars. The other cast members were good, not great, and I must add that Lydia Lawson-Baird, who only says two or three lines, will practically melt your heart with her sweet presence upon screen.Overall, it's a cute movie, good for kids. Don't watch this movie expecting something Oscar-worthy. If you're looking for a kid-appropriate movie, then this is the movie for you.","

","Yes, it's true that this is another delightfully told Christmas story. Yes, it has some laughs for the whole family. Yes, it's original and maybe a little heartfelt. But, it just falls short of being something more.It has its moments, but I think the story overall doesn't have a lot of luster to it. This movie seemed constrained to maintain its ""family movie"" status. Which is fine, but there were too many moments that seemed to stoop down a level just to please the younger audience.In addition, the ending was completely not what I expected. Basically, the movie adds up to being a fine holiday family film, but it just wasn't special enough to be truly memorable.","

","Elf by my usual standards was not what I would call a good movie. Do notinterpret that the wrong way. I enjoyed watching it very much, and I have found myself quoting lines from it for days afterward. It just didn't have the substance that movie needs for me to classify it as good. Will Ferell was great as Buddy the Elf. While I watched this movie I found myself wishing I could be as carefree and innocent as the character Buddy is in this movie. Granted he didn't know any better, but that's part of the humor. I think everyone wishes they could be more like Buddy to a degree, and that's whatmakes this movie so charming.The length of this movie was rather short, but that's probably a good thing.Charming and cute though this movie was, any longer than 95 minutes and Iwould've made up an excuse to leave.

","This is a truly funny tribute to MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET and RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER. The references to RUDOLPH are very clear, but if you haven't seen that one, you'll still find this a funny movie. If you remember the seventies, you'll feel a certain nostalgia, what with the presence of Ed Asner, Bob Newhart and, as the voice of a Burl Ives snowman counterpart, Leon Redbone. (The snowman even looks like Leon Redbone, just as RUDOLPH's snowman resembles Burl Ives.) James Caan shows an ability with pathos and Will Ferrell has a silent movie comedian's ability to appear simultaneously naive and knowing. I also like the fact that the department store in this is the now-defunct Gimbel's. I understand this was the case because Macy's wanted script changes. It works as a New York movie, too. Check it out.","

Avoid. unless your kids make you watch this movie.,"

","I was taken completely by surprise moments ago upon discovering that the current average rating for this movie was 7.3. I might have chuckled twice the entire movie; an episode of almost any current sitcom would yield more laughs in its half-hour (and would cost much less, too)! It was so bad that I commented to my wife that the movie needed a laugh track (maybe I'm watching too much TV...). I am so disappointed with this movie that I'm sending a photocopy of my ticket stub to New Line Cinema to ask for a refund. Will Farrell was trying, but he had little to work with; the entire production was simply too weak (point: studios really need to put out fewer, better movies: in the 70's, I remember that ""Star Wars"" played at one local theater for more than a year. Nowadays, a ""smash"" is here and gone in 2 weeks.). I'm almost as disappointed with my fellow IMDb users as I am with this movie: I used to consider IMDb a good barometer of a movie's worth; I'm very suspicious now. My only hope is that this is some kind of IMDb abuse perpetrated by New Line Cinema. Hope not...","

I went in with an open mind, and am normally very forgiving of movies that aren't necessarily my type, but this just made me squirm in my seat in a way few recent movies have.  I know the critics did not like ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" three years ago.  To me, this was worse.

","As far as TV was full of rubbish on Christmas night, I chose to watch ""Elf"" as the less annoying program. I am prejudiced with this kind of comedies and unfortunately I was unlucky enough to confirm my opinion once again. Except the 4-5 first minutes (before the opening credits), the whole thing was a huge disappointment. It is supposed to be a film for Christmas Spirit and lost childishness. Probably, Ι have a distorted point of view on how Christmas Spirit should be presented and what can be the meaning (at least for the people who still believe in it).Peace, love, altruism. ""Elf"" tries to convince the audience that Christmas Spirit is overconsumption in the nearest mall and Santa Claus is a guy who takes a break between the shots of a well known refreshment's advertising. I fully agree to a previous review saying that this film was made without any talent and producers should offer the amount given for the ""Elf"" to the homeless (if they really wanted to promote Christmas Spirit). Another paradox in this movie is that the main contributors are Jewish. That means that they could not have a real feeling for the subject they have chosen to film. Really, what is the necessity of a Menorah as a background in the Doctor's waiting room or snowflakes made of paper depicting the Star of David in a film for Christmas? Plot was totally predictable without any deviation from Hollywood's formula for family ""comedies""...(The kind-hearted naive hero who manages to change the hardhearted guy at the end bla bla bla)... James Caan done his best(and he succeeded)and his poorly written character was decent. Will Ferrell was unbearable as usual.My opinion.....Chose something else!!!","

","Elf is supposed to be a comedy, but it's more along the lines of travesty. We're supposed to laugh every time Will Ferrel's character Buddy does something boneheaded, but I found myself cringing and moaning almost every time he showed up on screen. Relentless stupidity and disgusting sight gags are supposed to pass for humour here, and it seems to be the only trick Elf has up its sleeve. For example, in one scene Buddy chugs a bottle of Coke down and starts to burp continuously for 12 seconds. In another, he licks bird excrement off of a rail. Ugh.This buffoonery continues for 97 minutes, and it never gets any less painful. I could comment on the acting, but I don't know what to say. The actors all do a perfect job of being unbearable. The camera-work and sound are both fine as well. In fact, the cinematography is the high point of the film. However, when the best thing about a movie is the camera angle, you know it stinks. Little kids will love it, though.","

","Will Ferrell is funny. This movie is not.In *Elf*, Ferrell is Buddy, a normal-sized human raised by Santa's elves (hence, thinks himself an elf), who is sent out into the world ostensibly to find his real daddy, but in reality to get his clumsy, over-sized derriere out of the tiny toy factory. In Christmastime New York, still wearing his elf getup, he discovers his father is Sonny Corleone, which must make him Andy Garcia.Rounding out the cast are bland Zooey Deschanel, inattentive Faizon Love, untalented Andy Richter, drunk Artie Lange, gruff Edward Asner, and cameos by Amy Sedaris, Kyle Gass and director Jon Favreau.Another of those Santa-Is-Real films, with the paradox of insufferably obtuse parents not believing in him even though toys must mysteriously appear under the tree every year.Gags that ""pop"" in a 30-second trailer fall absolutely flat in the context of the film and of course, The Message of ""everyone needs to believe in a Fantasy to quell their inherent loathsome selfishness"" is delivered with the subtlety of Rosie O'Donnell cannonballing nude into a public swimming pool.Sonny Corleone must whack Santa, and Buddy must whack Joey Zaza as revenge for wiping out the New York dons and everyone lives happily ever after.That's not how it ends. That's just my Christmas wish.","

","""Christmas is a time to be extra jerk"" is pretty much an attitude of every villains in every Christmas movie (even Die Hard 2). But the villain whose heart will eventually change by either ghosts, or Christmas-related miracle in Elf is not really someone you sympathize with. And that person is the Elf's father, which the audience will most likely hate him more than they like Elf.""Will you tuck me in Dad?"" ""No, I will not tuck you in.""To be fair, Elf is a grown man, and it will be creepy to tuck him in. But my point is not whether or not the father should tuck his grown son in. The point is, what kind of writer/director would want to put that scene into their movie? What kind of reaction should we have? Why is it funny? Is it funny because Elf is being stupid? Is it funny because the father is feeling awkward? Is it funny because of their tone of voice? Or is this the climax scene? I can never tell.But I am getting ahead of myself. The movie started out extremely cute. Elf and his adopted father are both characters that we can all love even before they say a word. And we continue to throughout the movie. That is the problem because, guess what? People don't want to see bad things happen to the characters they love. And the whole Elf being in New York and get tease and push around by people, though he didn't feel bad by it (because of his innocence, which makes us love him even more), frustrated me even more. There are also scene like when Elf want to give raccoon a hug but instead the raccoon bites him. That's not funny. That's awful. The fake looking talking Penguin at the North Pole shows that the director and the production team didn't plan on making this movie a classic (and by all mean, it isn't) which is sad because with some more thought into it, this movie could have been so much better. May be even a good movie. Considering how well this movie made in the box office.Everything about it is a downer. The snowball fight was mean and unrealistic. The kid in this movie is a very bad actor (which is strange for this kind of movie). Santa Clause talked like he's reading Declaration of Independent. The view of New York is not at all beautiful. And the love interest character has absolutely no dimension. The way she change her emotion from bitter goth to Legally Blonde in a split second is beyond the definition of the word believable.I thought this was going to be a very funny movie for a whole family since its DVD release was hyped up so much (and consider the fact that it did very well in the box office). But it turn out to be too dumb for adult, too dark and harsh for kids, and too uncomfortable to watch for anyone in between. Cute idea. Sloppy (cross that, very bad) execution.Panasit","

","Ebert starts his review of Elf this way:""If I were to tell you 'Elf' stars Will Ferrell as a human named Buddy who thinks he is an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus, would you feel an urgent desire to see this film? Neither did I. I thought it would be clunky, stupid and obvious, like 'The Santa Clause 2' or 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas.' It would have grotesque special effects and lumber about in the wreckage of holiday cheer...""And that's just how I saw it: clunky, stupid and obvious. And let me add, painfully unfunny. I cheerfully admit that I am in the minority here; Rotten Tomatoes has it at 83% I think, essentially a rave, and Ebert gives it three stars.We turned it off after half an hour, and, if watching by myself, I might have turned it off after the nearly endless opening credits, because I knew I was in trouble. Very early in the film, Santa Claus sees something moving in his bag of toys. He says, ""What in the name of Sam Hill is that?"" Gee, what a useless, trite thing to say at the first moment of tension in the film. Even a simple scream would have been an improvement.Ferrell's performance has been praised; I found him unlikable and tiresome. We've seen too much of this before, and done better, as in Starman, Moscow on the Hudson, and Time after Time: the naive waif encountering modern civilization for the first time. The elevator scene is almost funny: Buddy joyfully pushes all the buttons. What does the stranger in the elevator do or say? NOTHING! What a riot. Buster Keaton could have saved the scene with his ""great stone face,"" but here it's just one more opportunity squandered.Is there anything good about this film? Yes, Bob Newhart puts in a welcome appearance, but it's a good thing that his old stand-up comedy persona is that of looking ""out of place and anxious about it,"" because that's exactly how he looks here in his elf costume, talking to the camera. Fortunately it's mildly amusing rather than yet another embarrassment. The special effects are reasonable... ""Buddy"" is convincingly a lot bigger than all the elves, though his animated toy friends look off, somehow. The paintings used during the opening credits are attractive. I saw nothing else to like about this awful, painful film.Alan Nicoll www.angelfire.com/art/megathink","

","When I first saw the advertisements and previews for 'Elf', I thought that it looked like one of the dumbest films ever to be shown in cinemas. I thought: 'why would anyone want to see that stupid-looking film with that stupid-looking elf in pretty yellow tights and a green suit'? But, people saw it; some people I know saw it, and they said it was good, and I had to ask them if they were getting therapy. Well, anyway, I was wrong about the film. It has not been the first time, and it probably won't be the last. Whilst flying in the air, the airline showed this film, and I caught the later three-fourths (and watched the entire film shortly afterward). I *actually* thought that the film was funny - not just funny, but it was hilarious in some places. I can even still remember some of the events that made me laugh, but I won't post them here and spoil them, and some of them have to be seen to be appreciated.Now, this is not a great film, so don't expect it to be a flawless masterpiece. Just expect to get a couple hours of laughter and a semi-touching story about an innocent and naive elf misplaced in the city. I recommend that you see it this holiday season. It will make you laugh and put you in the Christmas spirit - er, elf.","

","Saw a preview showing and have to say that I was disappointed in the final product.""Elf"" is the story of Buddy (Will Farrell), who grows up at the North Pole after Santa finds him in his bag of toys after returning from another Christmas Eve. Buddy is raised as any other elf, but his human size starts to make life difficult. So off he goes to find his human father, played by James Caan. He soon finds that his real father already has a son that gets no attention.The story concept is interesting enough, and for that reason the first 15 minutes (which show the back story up through Will Farrell's departing the North Pole) are fairly entertaining. The jokes about Buddy's size are not overplayed as they could have been. There's an effective scene that involves Buddy and jack-in-the-boxes that was understatedly funny.Then, it all goes downhill. Farrell is effective as Buddy, doing a pretty good fish-out-of-water job in NYC. But a lot of the jokes that could have gone into the story seem left out. He seems to adjust way to quickly to his surroundings.Things get a little better as Buddy discovers love, both for the opposite sex and for his long, lost father. But again it seems like the director misses what he was aiming for. There are a lot of missed opportunities to flush out James Caan's relationship with his young son. Instead we are quickly shown the distance between them, with very little else to go on.The ending sequence is totally off the mark. The idea that Central Park would be deserted seems downright impossible, yet the movie progresses as if it's a real possibility.In the end, the movie just doesn't deliver an its hilarious possibility.","

","(There Are Spoilers) Buddy the Elf, Will Ferrell, never seemed to fit in with his fellow Elfs in Santa's, Edward Anser, workshop at the North Pole. Being a couple of sizes bigger then the Elfs that he lived and worked with at the toy factory Buddy felt out of place and with his overly big hands he was clumsy in making toys as perfectly and delicately as your average Elf. Buddy considered himself to be, to the horror of his fellow Elfs, a ""Cotton-Headed Ninny Muffin"". One day Buddy's dad Papa Elf, Bob Newheart, came clean with the obviously confused Buddy and let the truth come out: Buddy your not an Elf your a Human. Buddy,were told, was left at the steps of an Cathloic Orphanage to be brought up by the Nuns there. One Christman Eve Santa came to town and Buddy slipped into his bag of toys and ended up in the North Pole and was secretly made to think that he's an Elf by Santa Papa Elf and all the Elfs working there. Now with the truth about him and his real dad Walter Hobbs, James Caan, a greedy and unfeeling children's book publisher who's, O' My God, on Santa's naughty list! Buddy crosses the seven levels of the Candy Cane Forest and past the Sea of Twirly Swirly Gumdrops and finally goes through, on foot, the Lincoln Tunnel to the magic city, New York, to finally meet his dad who he never knew up until now. Looked at as ""Some kind of Nut"" at first Buddy's good and child-like nature, as well as his belief in the Christmas Spirit and Santa Claus, wins over everyone that he meets. From his dad Walter to his step-mom Emily Hobbs and younger brother Michael, Mary Steenburgen & Daniel Tay,as well as Jovie, Zooey Deschanel, the girl who he worked with as an Elf, what else,at Gimbel's Depertment Store. Through Buddy's skills as a toy maker as well as his all around good nature he made believer's of everyone in New York City that there is a Santa as well as a Christmas Spirit. Buddy did it with a little help from his newly found and made friends who at first didn't believe him and even thought that he was just a wee bit mentally unstable. Heartwarming Christmas Movie with Will Ferrell perfect as Buddy the Elf who saved Christmas with James Cann as his grouchy but later Santa believing dad. Jovie who has a beautiful singing voice but was too stage frighten to sing in front of people, she only could sing in the shower, was so motivated by Buddy's actions to open up her voice in public at New Yorks Central Park, singing a Christmas Carol, where everyone in the park joined in including Buddy's at first apprehensive dad Walter. This gave Santa's sled the power to lift it up above the clouds and fly higher then it did, with the Christmas Spirit that powered Santa's Raindeer driven Sled in everyones singing the Christmas Carol, for years.","

","I just hate Christmas - I really do. I hate everything about it. But I really enjoyed this movie. It was by no means brilliant - no comedy of this kind could ever be called such - but it was incredibly sweet and adorable. If you are someone who doesn't like cute or silly humor, you will hate this movie. It's the sort of thing that might give you a toothache. But if you like cuteness and silliness - innocent, simple humor - you will love this movie as I did. Yeah, it's full of all the typical lame Christmas schmaltz and the santa stuff and all that groan-worthy ""christmas spirit"" pap, but I was able to enjoy it anyway, for the same reasons I enjoyed the old puppet rudolph and frosty shows. It's done in a very cute way that makes it palatable. It really made me laugh (in fact, at one point I had an uncontrollable giggle fit over how cute it was) and days later I still think about it every now and then and smile.Again, not a smart or brilliant movie, but very sweet.Also, I totally agree with others on this board - that Infinifilm thing is just terrible. I really liked the movie, but if I were going to watch it again I'd want to just watch it - not have these interruptions, and if I were going to watch the special features (which I would have loved to) I'd want to just access them without having to go through the whole film again. JUST TERRIBLE! I was disappointed I didn't get to see the special features but, forget about it!","

","Elf is a throwaway comedy in which it feels like the actors aren't really trying. Every line is flat. The first 20 minutes of the film is in narrative format. Narrative is a crutch for a writer, it's the opposite of ""Show, don't tell"". There is something really off with the pacing.And the bits with Bob Newhart looking sad and unenergetic are really boring. How can anyone find that funny? It shocks me deeply. Maybe the film picks up (as Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace did after the first 20 minutes). But I didn't get that far. I like the occasional kids film but this one was awful. For Will Ferrell films, see Anchorman instead.Who should see Elf:-- Kids only, and maybe not even kidsI'll give Elf a 4 out of 10 which is the highest rating I'll give a film I couldn't sit through all the way.","

","Jon Favreau has directed a cute and quirky Christmas movie that will leave both children and parents satisfied. A script that could have easily been thought of as too dark and absurd (the absurd moments in the film are one of its many strengths) is pulled together by a man who continues to amaze me in every film he's in: Will Ferrell. Will Ferrell brings an edge of naivete to the character that is so charming and hilarious it makes it incredibly easy to sit through a film about Santa's attempt to regain the Christmas spirit. In the movie Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who grows up to believe that he is actually and overgrown Christmas Elf and eventually finds out that he is adopted.  Buddy sets out on a journey to the wonderful land of New York City to meet his biological father played by James Caan. Injected with many weird and quirky moments (including a cast of claymation animals a la ""Rudolf The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and a group of villains ominously know as ""The Central Park Rangers"") everyone puts in a good amount of charisma. Zooey Deschanel is quite memorable as the love interest with the sultry singing voice and Edward Asner is pitch perfect as a realistically jolly Santa Claus (Faison Love also puts in good performance as the Gimbel's Department store manager). Not a classic by any stretch of the mind Buddy is a great film to take the kids to see. Though I saw this film in a test screening in October I definitely felt the Holiday spirit. Yes, the movie has its syrupy sweet ""Good Lord this is corny!"" moments, but the off the wall bits of comedy balance the storyline out as a whole.Favreau and Ferrell are fully aware of what moments are sterotyped genre dreck and seem to ham it up.Buddy is worth seeing for Ferrell's performance alone, mixed with both Favreau's sense of humor and direction its stands out amongst the sea of the standard Disneyfied X-mas tales.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4393948/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw4393948,6," It's pretty g
","""Elf"" starring Will Ferrell is seen by many as one of the greatest Christmas comedies in recent times. I, myself, am one of these people. Though it was released in theatres over a decade ago, ""Elf"" remains to be a staple in many Christmastime traditions, telling the story of a elf-human named Buddy as he stumbles through New York in search of his family. I first saw the film when I was about seven years old, having been suggested I watch it with my younger sister by my parents and at the time, I thought it was just about the most hilarious movie I had ever seen. I enjoyed every second of Buddy's shenanigans as did thousands of other children across the nation. 
 Director Jon Favreau also known for producing the ever popular marvel movies which include all three ""Iron Man"" movies and ""The Avengers"" including ""Avengers: Infinity War"", gifts moviegoers everywhere with the amazing story of ""Elf"". There is not a single dull moment throughout the entire film. Already, in the opening seconds of the movie, viewers are presented with a colorful, storybook style introductory credits featuring an adorable cartoon penguin and a first taste of an incredible soundtrack. The movie then begins with an opening shot of an orphanage. Viewers are then taken over to a single crib holding the child who will become the main focus of the movie. Then, only moments later, Santa Claus drops down into the room with his sack of toys, into which, the baby promptly crawls into and stows away back to Santa's workshop. Only until after Santa returns to the North Pole, is the baby noticed, and is taken in by the elves, launching the viewers into the main portion of the film. 
 Buddy, his name given to him by the elves upon his discovery, already appears extremely different from the rest of his elves, and rather humorously at that. He is double the height of his co-workers and is visibly inept at building toys. Will Ferrell proves to be the perfect actor to display this stark contrast. Eventually, Buddy realizes that the reason he is so unlike everyone around him is because he is not even of the same race as them. Viewers are then treated to a truly entertaining realization/flashback sequence of Buddy's severe discomforts with the facilities built for elves, who are rather small, instead of humans. Buddy is reasonably distraught with this revelation, to which he confides in his father figure, Papa Elf. He is then told his true father resides in New York, but unfortunately is on Santa's ""Naughty List"". Buddy then sets off to New York City, in hopes of finding his family and redeeming his father.
 Viewers are presented with yet another incredibly entertaining montage of Buddy's antics as he travels through New York, marveling at various common occurrences in the city ranging from the everyday escalator to the street side trash can. Upon his arrival, Buddy's family is quite skeptical of the thirty year old elf-man who just appeared, maintaining that he is one of them. Despite how they may receive him initially, we are treated to several bonding montages between Buddy and his new brother, Michael, who will then eventually bring his father and mother closer to Buddy. All the while, Buddy makes new friends throughout the city and spreading the message of Christmas Spirit. 
 However, humor isn't all that this movie provides for those who watch it. ""Elf"" also tackles more mature themes including death, struggles in the workplace, and family disputes. Many movies contain both humorous and emotional moments, but few can create a balance between the two resulting in a near-perfect film. However, pure humor and emotion isn't just what makes this film great. As mentioned before, the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal and each and every scene is improved significantly with the addition of the movie's incredible background music. I couldn't ask for a more iconic, amazing, Christmas movie than ""Elf"" and I am certain that a great many others feel exactly the same way.","

I love all Christmas films, but this is probably the best. Unfortunately, the older I get, this film becomes less realistic so for some it may make them emotional, but I guess that just proves how strong this movie is. It has a great message. There are some questionable times in the movie where Will Ferrell comes off as a bit sarcastic, not really living up to the elf he's playing, but this should probably go over young children's heads. There are so many great lives in the movie...it may have only been released about 15 years ago, but it's certainly without a doubt a classic, and Will Ferrell is at his best. If you don't already watch it every Christmas season, I encourage you to start doing so right now!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4034711/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw4034711,NA," Why Santa's Sleigh Can Fly
","I read the list of Trivia, goofs and continuity. Someone said Santa's sled should not fly just because people believe. Santa's Sled flew because when Jovi was having her Ramen Noodles on Christmas Eve and saw Buddy on the TV News she set her dinner down and went to Central Park. She met Michael and the Mom. She remembered: ""The best way to spread Christmas Cheer is singing loudly for all to hear."" (First rule of being an elf). She gets up and her singing causes the crowd to sing. Michael's (and Buddy's) Dad shows up, and during the singing Michael notices Dad is not singing. Dad says yes he is. Michael says Daaaaad!!!! so Hobbs starts singing. Just when he does start actually singing loudly the sled flies right up and over his head. It was their Singing Loudly for All to Hear which made the sled fly. The idea of seeing Santa or not well that is just not important. The idea is to be good to Sing Loudly to show love to your children and spend time with them and care for them, not just your self or your problems. Actually when he quit that job at Greenway, things got better. And he spent more time with Buddy and ideally and of course Michael as well. Seeing a Santa, real or not, is really depending on if there is a person in your group or your Mall or your Community Meeting Places, who dresses up like Santa and does the what do you want /pictures thing. Some give presents. It depends on the situation and the groups. Some people just have their family members who give gifts and Santa is not needed. Believing in giving to others is the Message of the Santa Character. The Santa Myth The Santa Tradition, and of course the first persons who so long ago went around with a bag and gave gifts. Maybe he was old. Maybe he wanted to be anon. Long ago the tradition began and it continues. Animals that run and want to flee from wolves such as reindeer, deer, bunnies and so on, the wish they could fly. They do if they get written into a story to fly. Sometimes I think it would be cool to fly. Flying is faster and you can get above everything and get there faster. Now the chimney thing. That must be because who wants to have to watch their doors for a stranger, unannounced and sneaking in their homes at night? Nobody. So someone made the story fantastical with the chimney thing. That ought to be phased out. Maybe in the olden days when kids were forced to be chimney sweeps like in the old original film Oliver Twist. Maybe Santa was in the chimneys & fireplaces with gifts to cheer those fellows up. I like to think so. They had a hard life. Those kids sure needed cheering up and needed to be saved from being forced to be chimney sweeps. So Labor Reform Laws... Good. The Mail Room Funny. I like the redemptive and loving and good messages in this film. That there were car crashes because of that man running around in those tights sure is believable that's kind of sad. After a while you get used to the costume, and e the new outfit his Dad gave him is great. The first sight of him there in the City is quite shocking. A film with lots of surprising things, not to use the word shocking again. Does syrup have sugar? lol K.J.H.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3649663/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw3649663,7," Will Ferrell Creates Iconic Christmas Character
","Like most people around the holidays, I'm usually up for a watching (or re-watching) of the great holiday classics (""Wonderful Life"", ""Home Alone"", etc.). For whatever reason, however, it took me until 2016 to actually sit down and watch ""Elf"" all the way through. While maybe not jumping up to the top of my ""all-time Christmas list"", I did find Elf to be an enjoyable romp.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Buddy (Ferrell), a human boy raised in the North Pole due to a mix-up with Santa Claus (Ed Asner). For most of his life, Buddy believes he is an actual elf, until realizing his shortcomings in that community. As such, he decides to strike out for the ""human world"" in order to find his real father (James Caan). Along the way, Buddy (as a result of his endearing cheerfulness) brings a bit of Christmas spirit to all those around him that are in dire need of it, including a young retail worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).To me, ""Elf"" is primarily a success because of the iconic character that Ferrell creates. The script/plot itself is about as irrelevant and corny as they come, but Ferrell's quirky energy steals every single scene. Quotes like ""You sit on a throne of lies"", ""Bye buddy, hope you find your Dad!"", and ""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?"" will forever be burned into my memory! I don't think there is an actor out there who could have played Buddy as perfectly as Ferrell.Simply put, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched ""Elf"" from beginning to end. I don't know if it will get watched religiously every Christmas in my home (time will tell on that one...but maybe it will grow on me even more!), but I can tell you that I will be quoting it going forward!","

As soon as he finds his father, he wants to gain his love and affection. He does hilarious things to achieve that.Buddy is clumsy and very charming in its own special way and you can 't avoid to like him. The story is quite simple but I never get bored to watch that movie. I have been doing this every year since I was a teenager. No Christmas without Buddy the elf. It is something you can watch with the family or on your own. The film covers romance in a charming way without overdoing it or getting cheesy. It is very funny without forcing it too much. I am not a big fan of Romance or Comedy but this lovely movie gem has all going for it. You get the Christmas spirit and what's really important packed in a wonderful and entertaining film. I strongly recommend to watch it. Hopefully you will love it as much as I do.","

Because there's no greater joy than that of a peaceful mind..","

","Elf is essentially a Christmas classic nowadays, and for good reason. This movie is funny, sweet, and extremely quotable. The film follows Buddy the elf on his quest to NYC to find his birth father. It's a ridiculous concept executed very well. Buddy encounters many crazy characters and situations on his journey. He discovers the wildness of New York as he tries to adjust to life as a human.Will Ferrell makes a hilarious Buddy. His random screams of excitement and childlike joy make for a lovable protagonist. He is full of innocence and Christmas joy, making him someone you can root for and care about. I love this film since I grew up watching it and it still holds a special place in my heart. I make sure to re-watch it every year around Christmas!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3604495/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw3604495,6," Reminds you that it's no fun being cynical
","At first glance, Elf would appear to be one of countless holiday- season cash-ins with daft costumes and even sillier special effects, featuring a well-known actor performing pantomime on a bigger budget and grabbing an easy pay-day in the process. That is stars Will Ferrell, one of cinema's most naturally hilarious funnymen who seems to be caught up in an endless loop of mediocrity - Blades of Glory and Stranger than Fiction excluded - as the titular human-turned- elf, bodes even worse. Throw in some little people dressed in elf costumes and a romance involving surely the only woman to accept a date with a man who claims to be from the North Pole, and it would seem like a movie tailor-made for a critical beat-down.Only Elf is genuinely charming, and even more alarmingly, incredibly funny at times. Using Ferrell's man-child comedy chops to the fullest extent, this may actually be the best work Ferrell has ever done. He plays Buddy, an orphan accidentally whisked off to Santa's homeland as a baby. Taken in by the sympathetic Papa Elf (the wonderful Bob Newhart), it doesn't take long until Buddy is towering over his adoptive father and his co-workers. Learning of his biological pop Walter (played by James Caan) and that he is in fact a human, the 6-foot elf journeys to New York City to be with his real family, only for his miserable publisher dad to shun him. Buddy learns that his world no longer buys into tales of flying reindeers and a jolly fat man who knows if we've been bad, disbelieving in the 'magic' of Christmas and draining the power from Santa's sleigh in the process.Directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum, Elf is pretty standard stuff story-wise, and is hampered by a predictable sub-plot involving Walter's struggling publishing company and his dire need to lighten up. Yet there are many touching moments, particularly in the scenes involving Buddy and his young half- brother, and the former's awkward courting of a pretty toy store assistant (Zooey Deschanel) initially freaked out by his maniacal claims but who eventually succumbs to his hyperactive charms. It all inevitably leads to a climax built around a special-effect laden set-piece as Santa struggles to deliver the presents with a dying sleigh, but this is expected from a movie designed to win over those looking for something easy-going and festive. The world has grown cynical, and perhaps so have I, but Elf reminded me that it is no fun being so.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3601946/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw3601946,6," 6.5/10
","Thirty years prior to the events of the film, a baby crawls into Santa's sack at an orphanage. Santa unwittingly takes the baby back to the North Pole, where it is decided that Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) will raise him. The baby, named Buddy (Will Ferrell), is raised unaware that he is actually a human, until his enormous size and poor toy-making abilities cause Papa Elf to tell him the truth. The old elf reveals that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells and placed up for adoption, that Walter never knew Buddy was born, and that he now works at a children's book company in New York. Immediately and full of optimism, Buddy sets out for New York to find his father.""Elf"" is self consciously structured in the most academical and basic way screenplays are written, it is screen writing 1-0-1 and it knows that, so even though it cannot be commended for a remarkable depth, there is just no resisting the charm and the comedy this film has to offer with what is possibly, still to this day, Ferrel's best performance.For someone who has always been somewhat of a Ferrell critic: I have rarely been able to enjoy his comedies and sketches, this film really surprised me and that is exactly because Ferrel is cast perfectly in the role of an over-enthusiastic human who thinks he is an elf. His zany and over the top comedy and his exaggerated facial gestures fit this film perfectly and grace us with moments of really good comedy. Favareau knows how to build upon this and has always the right camera set-up to enhance the comedic effect. He uses the classic shtick of people or objects entering or exiting into frame to incredible effect and even does some innovative things with the technique that really surprised me and had me rolling with laughter.The film also has a classic Christmas message and story: the characters by the end need to save Christmas and to do so they have to believe in the Christmas spirit. It is standard stuff, but the film is written very effectively and its colorful characters navigate through a sufficiently original premise and set-pieces which make for an undeniably pleasant flow. You care about everyone involved thanks to some solid work from all the performers. Yet, once again, what really pushes the film a notch above has to be the comedy, it is inventive and always different, it does not go for the same gag over and over again as it would be easy to do with a fish-out-of-water story.As I said, ""Elf"" cannot be praised for bringing to the table something new. The structure is predictable down to every emotional beat. There isn't a sense of overwhelming emotion involved with the characters and their struggle is never really given depth exactly because we know how it is going to go.Still, the fact that the film is self conscious about that helps it build around a pleasant family movie which is also a very good Christmas comedy with enough flare to keep you pleasantly entertained for the whole duration.","

","Probably the greatest Christmas movie of all time, Jon Favreau's Elf is made wonderful by Will Ferrell's disarmingly innocent performance as Buddy. Many of the best scenes are Ferrell in character walking around New York and interacting with people, places and things. A sweet screenplay and magical direction from Favreau also boost this beautifully novel idea.Ferrell's deliriously happy Buddy is the film's heart and soul, but there's much to be said for James Caan's flawlessly cast Walter Hobbs, Buddy's biological father. Grumpy and irritated in that quintessentially ""dad"" kind of mood, Caan owns the role and performs even better in the film's final warm scenes. Zooey Deschanal is cute but her romance with Buddy is carried by the writing and Ferrell's committed fervor, as Deschanal drones the film's lines with dead eyes and little energy. Faizon Love as the manager of a toy store that Buddy accidentally works at for a day is a scene stealer.Elf is sweet and cheesy in that ideal Christmas film way. Its an essential for the holidays alongside Love, Actually and probably Ferrell's most delightful work to date.","

That entire scene is worth the entire movie. Don't let the negative reviews turn you off. If your kids appreciate good humor and pratfalls, they'll get it.""Dad!

","I thought this movie was really good. It's funny, it's light, it's carefree and simple. It's a movie the whole family can enjoy.This movie is about Buddy. He was a baby in an orphanage and on Christmas Eve, when Santa came, he sneaked his way into Santa's sack of toys and ended going to the North Pole with him. An elf adopted him and cared for him as if he were his own. When Buddy grew up, he never knew why he was so big compared the other children. One day, when he was an adult, they told him that he isn't an elf. Buddy was surprisingly okay with it, and set off to New York City to find his birth Dad. Once he does, he tries so hard to get his Dad to like him, but nothing worked. Eventually, Buddy had to stay with his Dad and his Dad's wife and kids. Buddy met a beautiful girl who worked in a department store. Buddy set up all Christmas decorations, as an elf would do. Eventually, his Dad believes him when he says for the umpteenth time that he's an elf. And everything works out.Recommended for: Families and children.Do they say the title of the movie, in the movie: Yes.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.","

The good supporting cast, including Zooey Deschanel, does a fine job. However, James Caan (as Elf's real father) is a ""cooler"" and sucks all the life out of the story, along with the dreadful office scenes. (I found the mail-room and ""midget"" book-author sub-plots to be stupid.) Like ""Santa Claus"" it's very uneven, and only comes back-to-life at the very end. Both Bob Newhart and Ed Asner are fine as ""Papa Elf"" and ""Santa"". Will Ferrell is surprisingly good as a 6 ft. tall ""Elf"". But NYC is not at all magical here, except for Rockefeller Plaza. Please note that Gimbels Dept. Store went out of business about 16 years before this movie was made. ""Zooey"" is adorable as ""Mrs. Elf"" at the movie's end.","

Elf is always one that I watch, every single year without fail, it is everything a Christmas film should be and much more! Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls in to Santa's sack when a baby one Christmas Eve & is accidentally taken back to the North Pole. Santa and his Elves realise that he must have crawled in as Santa visited an orphanage & as he has no parents, one of the elves steps forward and raises him. The story then fast forwards 20 years or so and Buddy leaves the North Pole and travels to New York to find his real Dad (who happens to be on the naughty list!!).Will Ferrell does an incredibly good job at playing his part and the supporting cast are equally as good. There are no rude or edgy bits (which is unusual for a Will Ferrell movie) and it is very much a family film, suitable for all ages! Elf is a real festive, feel good, classic Christmas film with a great cast, fantastic story and many hilarious moments.9/10","

","Basically, director Jon Favreau's goofy but entertaining Christmas comedy ""Elf"" is a 'fish-out-of-water' saga, and David Berenbaum's screenplay relies heavily on incongruity. Visually, ""Elf"" is a delightful little movie with interesting characters. The North Pole set and the costumes that the elves wear are colorful.""Elf"" concerns an infant up for adoption at an orphanage who crawls into Santa Claus' gift bag during Christmas and winds up at the North Pole. As it turns out, he is raised as one of the elves, specifically Papa Elf (Bob Newhart), who serves as the narrator. At six feet, three inches, Buddy (Will Ferrell) cannot do anything right as an elf. Ironically, Buddy has no idea that he isn't an elf. The revelation that he is not an elf staggers him. One day he is shown a picture of his mother and father. Tragically, Buddy's mother died without informing his father Walter Hobbs (James Caan of ""The Godfather"") that he had sired him. Buddy sets out from the North Pole and walks on foot to Manhattan where he finally comes face-to-face with Walter. Walter is married, has a teenage son, and works at a book publishing firm. Reluctantly, Walter takes Buddy into his house and disasters galore ensue. Briefly, Buddy holds a job at Gimbels' Department Store in the toy department. When he assaults a man masquerading as Santa Claus, Buddy lands in jail and Walter bails him out. Eventually, after exasperating Walter continually with his adolescent antics, Buddy leaves and is standing on a bridge surveying the river when Santa Claus (Ed Asner) streaks overhead in his sleight with his reindeer. Something goes wrong and Santa has to crash land. Naturally, Buddy heads to his rescue.Light, frivolous nonsense from start to finish, ""Elf"" qualifies as scintillating comedy with Ferrell having a field day as the tallest elf on record. This is Ferrell at his finest in an emerald jacket and golden tights. Mind you, the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian is an acquired taste. He behaves like an imbecile and he stoops to conqueror with lowest common denominator humor. James Caan is appropriately harried as his selfish father, and Oscar winning actress Mary Steenburgen plays Walter's wife Emily, while Zooey Deschanel is cast as Jovie, Buddy's love interest. ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage appears in an amusing small part as a children's book writer.","

","""Elf"" is a Christmas-themed comedy starring Will Ferrell. Ferrell plays Buddy, a human who, as a baby, accidentally crawled into Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) toy sack and upon discovery is adopted by an elf (Bob Newhart, playing a version of his harried TV personas).One fateful day, Buddy is told the truth of his parentage, and decides to travel to New York City to find his real father. While Buddy's biological mom is deceased, it turns out Buddy's biological father is Walter, a high-ranking editor at a book publishing firm. Walter has since married and has a preteen son. He's totally incredulous and annoyed at this goofy, grown man claiming to be his son. After several hijinks, Walter grudgingly accepts that Buddy is the real deal, but that doesn't make life with him any easier.Buddy's undaunted Christmas-minded mentality makes him an annoyance to most around him. He finds work at a department store where he falls in love with a coworker (Zooey Deschanel). Buddy's quest leads to several funny sequences as he gets to know his dad and the various people around him.Director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man"", ""Swingers"") lets Ferrell do his shtick but the narrative is held together very well. Some of the actors are mild caricatures but they manage not to overdo it, since virtually everyone is playing it straight compared to Ferrell's Buddy. Ferell plays Buddy as a man-child who is relentlessly positive, despite all the grumpiness that he encounters in the Big City. Look for amusing supporting parts by Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Artie Lange and Andy Richter.Since the film has no real villain, it allows the relationships to be developed without an arbitrary ""bad guy"" foil to overcome by the end. In an era where original Christmas holiday films are frequently run of the mill, ""Elf"" stands out as a charmer. It's endearing without being overly saccharine.","

There are so many great scenes and memorable quotes. The funniest scenes in the film are the ones where Ferrell calls out a fake Santa in the department store where he has been hired, and when he mistakes one of his father's associates (Peter Dinklage from Game of Thrones) for an elf. Those two scenes were great, but there were so many more hilarious moments playing on his confusion. The love story is also sweet and Zooey Deschanel shines in every scene she's in. James Caan plays Ferrell's father (who's in the naughty list) extremely well. Elf has turned into a Christmas classic, but the great thing about these comedies is that you don't need to wait for the Holiday season to enjoy them. Jon Favreau has proved he can direct some great films and he has a great sense of humor. It's been 11 years since it first was released and it continues to be a joyous experience.","

","I'm not a huge fan of Will Ferrell but I really enjoyed Elf! My family watches it every Christmas and we still laugh every year. Will Ferrell plays Buddy the Elf - really he is a human baby who has been raised at the North Pole. Ferrell is great as an innocent man-child with a heart of gold who loves Christmas way, way too much. My dad and I have always both loved Bob Newhart and he is great as the head elf who has raised Buddy all these years without telling him the terrible truth, but now that he's older and frustrated that he's not as handy as the other elves, he tells Buddy the truth and he goes to New York City to find his biological father. James Caan plays a mean, materialistic dad who cares only about his work, and Mary Steenbergen is fantastic as always as Caan's wife who makes him accept Buddy into their home. When Buddy falls into a job at a department store he meets his romantic interest, Zooey Deschannel, who is predictably funny as usual but surprisingly (at least to me) also is a great singer! Through the story, Buddy struggles to get Caan to accept him as his son, and to deal with living in the much less friendly and more complicated human world. On top of that he has to get Deschannel to see past his bizarre behaviour and get her to fall for him. Plus, there just might be a huge Christmas Eve disaster that only Buddy can help Santa solve. It's quite family friendly and a very fun and refreshing Christmas movie with some great laughs. Peter Dinklage's small part as a full of himself children's book author also has a great payoff. If you're a fan of Christmas movies or comedies in general, Elf is worth checking out.","

","'Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?'So a baby 'Buddy' climbs into Santa's sack and is whisked away to the North Pole by accident. Upon this discovery Santa decides to allow 'Papa Elf' to raise and look after him. Not too sure why they just didn't take him back to the orphanage where he crawled into the sack, seeing as they know he came from there. I guess him being an orphan it didn't matter?.From here on Buddy grows up at the North Pole as a worker in Santa's workshop. He soon discovers by mistake that he is in fact human and not an elf (elfling?), so off he goes to New York to find his dad. Turns out Papa Elf knew all about his mum and dad and what happened to them...somehow, handy huh. Is that elf magic or Christmas magic that enabled Papa Elf to know everything? or am I missing something here.So lets switch off the cynical part of my brain for a moment. The start of this film is a typical Xmas setting and scenario yes...but its so damn charming cozy and delightful you can't not love it. I mean sure you can't really go wrong with Santa's workshop at the North Pole really, but the added gem of seeing the odd bit of classic stop motion animation on one or two cheerful little characters really added another dimension to the whole sequence. It all looked like a whimsical children's story book, a snowy happy world with cutesy fantasy characters plodding around. Arctic Puffin and snowberries? adorable!!.Once we reach New York and the real world the tone shifts to that classic American Xmas movie magic type scenario which we all know and love from various other movies. And what better setting for a cold wintry Xmas tale than New York. Yeah you know straight away all the famous landmarks and stores you'll be seeing, we know how this goes...but does it get old? no, never. New York is probably one of the most atmospheric places in the world at Xmas.'I passed through the seven levels of the Candy Cane forest, through the sea of swirly twirly gum drops, and then I walked through the Lincoln Tunnel'This is basically a pure unadulterated Ferrell show, the whole thing is all about him as the innocent sweet childlike elf completely out of place in a dark sinister world. You have the obligatory love/hate issues with his real father played grumpily by Caan to great effect (you can feel the sense of shame and disdain he gives off for Buddy), all this of course plays out exactly how you think it will right from the start. Then you have all the visual tomfoolery that Buddy serves up as he comes to terms with reality and not the candy cotton world he's used to.At no point did I actually get tired or bored of Ferrell and his cherub- like virginal antics. It is utterly predictable hokey Xmas pantomime guff of course but its just so enchanting and visually pleasing you can't look away. Everywhere he goes he elaborately decorates with Christmas cheer, baubles and shiny trinkets, he's like the Xmas monster. Some of the scenes where he learns about 'human' ways and everyday things/objects are highly amusing despite being so simple and kinda cheesy. The board meeting where Buddy comes across the rather small elf-like Mr Finch (who is actually a little person) is hilarious. The way Buddy talks to the guy as if he were a very young child is easily a laugh out loud moment (must have been a South pole elf). I must also mention the brilliantly done forced perspective we see here and there. It looks like CGI but apparently its not, very clever and nice usage of an old trick.This is probably one of Ferrell's best films and best performances...strange as it may seem. The whole idea is completely not original and is stuffed to the gills with every Xmas cliché you can think of. The only reason this film works is because of the infantile character that is Buddy the elf...errr human. The ending is totally sappy and cringeworthy but it still doesn't stop this Christmas juggernaut of yuletide spirit. 'Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!'8/10","

","Elf reviewElf is an American Christmas comedy film, written by David Berenbaum and directed by actor Jon,  the film was released in 2003. The cast is mainly made up of Will Ferrell, James Caan, Bob Newhart, Ed Asnar and Zooey Deschanel; it was released in America on November 7th and it grossed over$220,400,000 worldwide. The plot is: one Christmas Eve a baby boy crawls into Santa's present sack while he's delivering gifts to children in an orphanage, Santa doesn't know that he has took the baby back to the North Pole, where Papa Elf volunteers to raise him. Through a misunderstanding the boy is renamed Buddy. He is raised unaware that he really is a human, not an elf- until his size and average toy making leads him to the truth. Papa Elf reveals to Buddy that his father is called Walter Hobbs, his mother was ('was' as she is dead) called Susan Wells and he was given up for adoption, his Dad still doesn't know that he exists. Walter now works at a children's book company in New York, Buddy then sets out to Manhattan to find his father. When he arrives in the 'Big Apple' Buddy tracks down his Dad in the Empire State Building, Buddy goes and sings to Walter in his elf suit just to be escorted out by security. The security tells Buddy (sarcastically) ""get back to Gimbels"" he takes that literally, he goes to the shop and is mistaken for a worker, there he meets Jovi a fellow worker.That night, the human-elf hides in the store for hours and decorates it from head to toe like the North Pole; it is soon revealed that Santa is arriving at Gimbels that day to meet children, Buddy then gets a shock when he realises he is not the genuine Santa that he knows. Then a fight breaks out between Buddy and the imposter, he is sentenced to 24 hours in jail. Eventually, Walter bails him out and takes him for a DNA test, the test reveals Buddy is actually Walter's son, he then takes Buddy home to meet his step-mother (Emily) and step-brother (Michael). The human-elf shocks the family with his weird diet, his childlike personality and the insistence that he actually walked from the North Pole to New York. Buddy becomes friends with Michael after a snowball fight in Central Park, Mike persuades his brother to ask out Jovi, his crush. I don't want to ruin the end in case you watch the film so I'll leave it there. Like I said in my previous review, I love Christmas films but I have high standards. Elf certainly meets those standards, it is humorous  for both child and teen (I can't say adult, I'm not an adult). It keeps Christmas spirit and is cute, the perfect film to put your tree up while watching it, or eat mince pies while watching it, practically you can do any traditional Christmas thing you want while watching it. All the cast do well but mostly Will Ferrell plays a great part, it's like he was made to play Buddy, he has all the characteristics: humour, silliness, etc. So it's well done to Jon Favreau you made one of the best Christmas films I've seen! RATING: 8.0/10Best parts: Arriving in New York Decorating Gimbels Snowball fight in Central Park","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2566064/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2566064,NA," Elf is fun
","This film is directed by Jon Favreau who has made his mark as a director of low budget films like ""Made"" and also as a character actor but this is his first effort at directing a mainstream Hollywood movie. He does a commendable job and as I watched this film I kept having the feeling that he purposely made the most commercial film that he could. Favreau as an actor has mostly appeared in small roles. As a director his small films are lucky to play at art house theaters and I seriously doubt he's getting rich hosting ""Dinner For 5"" on the Independent Film Channel. It looks as though he wanted to make a crowd pleasing film that will ultimately be playing on some cable channel for the rest of our lives. I'm not knocking this decision at all, it's a smart move and he's become a major Hollywood player with the success of this film. Even the script was carefully written to insure that WHEN this plays on television there will be nothing to edit out. The closest thing to a bad word is uttered by Caan when he says ""Hell"" once towards the end of the film. This is a fun film that does have undeniable charm and its heart is definitely in the right place. It's sentimental and corny but thats part of the appeal. The script doesn't try to hard and the energy and flow of the film keeps at a constant pace, it doesn't try to go over the top which is refreshing. Ferrell is a natural performer and his dopey wide eyed expressions never grow old. This film must be doing something right because tough guy James Caan is believable as a caring husband and father. Very old fashioned story that never raises itself above lightweight status is nonetheless funny and charming. Like I said earlier, this film will be playing on television every year for the rest of our lives!","

","This film is one for the whole family. I love Christmas and Christmas movies and this one is one of my top five. Buddy is perfect. He loves Christmas and everything about it. The story of how he becomes an ELF is almost believable unlike his SNL buddy Adam Sandler, who's movies are about as dumb and ""unbelieveable"" as anything on the screen today. Last movie I went to see of his, I actually felt stupid as I left the theater. Anyway, Bob Newhart is great (as always) as Papa Elf. And the girl is as cute as a button. By the way, I love ""Its a Wonderful Life"". But I think I might be the only person who likes it and also likes ""Elf"" and ""A Christmas Story"". Almost everyone who left a review that ""hates"" both these movies suggests watching Its A Wonderful Life instead. Im assuming they are in the 80-200 year old bracket. Enjoy the movie, its great! But if your an old ""crabby-patty"", don't bother.","

","This is probably the funniest Christmas movie that exists. It is one of my absolute favorites and it also has action, drama, romance, and a good plot with its humor. It is one of the few Christmas movies that has it all in it. Again, Will Ferrell has made a great movie, only your kids can actually watch this one. The adventures of the human/elf Buddy is very humorous filled with ups and downs and a good happy ending. If you don't own a copy, you should still at least watch it every Christmas season. It is in my top three favorite Christmas movies. So enjoy watching it. There are many other great actors and actresses in it as well which just add to the greatness of the movie. I hope that everyone here enjoys it.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2537743/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2537743,9," One of the Sweetest and Most Entertaining Christmas Movies around,
","Elf is a fantastic movie with a very well written plot and a great comedic cast. It's a film that I always insist on watching at Christmas time, because it's just so much fun, I never get tired of it. The humour remains constant throughout while still managing to be sweet and very charming. The only thing I ever felt was missing from Elf was more tension between Buddy and Jovie's relationship. It's too perfect, when they meet up there is a bit of conflict, but shortly after that they have no real issues, they should have made them split and convince the audience that they were not getting back together, so that it would feel more fulfilling once they did. The performances in this film are outstanding and everyone suits their roles perfectly, whether it be James Caan as a business executive who struggles with the responsibilities of being a father, Zooey Deschanel as a complicated girl who is confused with the idea of falling in love, Bob Newhart as the father of all the elves, or Edward Asner as Father Christmas himself. Everyone plays a character that suits them and their own characteristics or personalities perfectly. The highlight of the movie is of course Will Ferrell, he is funny, charming and very lovable, though the movie may not be that old, Ferrell's performance as Buddy the Elf is already iconic, we can relate to him on several occasions, whether it be his sense of optimism, trying to find the good in everyone, or even just his love for Christmas, there are several aspects that make him one of the most beloved characters of any Christmas movie, and Ferrell is to thank for most of that. Sweet, heartwarming and very, very funny, Elf is a perfect film to watch at Christmas time that the whole family will enjoy. When Buddy, a human raised by elves in the North Pole, learns that his real father lives in New York, he heads off to find him.Best Performance: Will Ferrell","

","What a funny movie! Original and unique in some aspects and classic in others. Basically one of the elves is really a human who was adopted and he is convinced he is an elf until finally one day he comes to New York City to see his real father. I love how it takes a while before they finally accept it, even after yelling and the usual chaos.I will have to rate this a 7/10 due to unfortunate language in the film. And unfortunately it lost another point due to the shower scene. I do understand the point of it, but it's still pushing it, since he even asks if he was there because she was naked. Other than that though, very funny movie!","

","So, aside from falling instantly in love with Zooey Deschanel when I first saw Elf way back in 2003, this movie still gets 10 stars from me because each and every year I watch it at least twice... and cry.It's like watching Tinkerbell come down from atop the Matterhorn at Disneyland, the penultimate scene in Elf. It awakens inside of me memories of youth, innocence and memories of a time when everything was new.Obviously I am cheesy and weak - but most of the year I am a bitter, aggressive atheist who compares believing in God to believing in Santa.But not when I watch this movie.I love the story, Mr. Narwhal, Bob Newhart (a god as true as any!), and Zooey singing. I love James Caan and Mary Steenburgen in this film too! Everyone inhabits their roles so seamlessly in my mind...And seriously - when was the last time you saw an 'elf' fly down a conference table to kick some ass? Anyhow, I am rambling. I love Bad Santa, A Christmas Story and Silent Night Deadly Night as much as the next guy, but to call Elf anything less than a classic, must see Holiday Movie on par with It's a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street is a crime.","

However, as he gets older, he soon realizes that he just can't live in an elf's world. He decides to go to New York City to find his real dad, who happens to be on the naughty list. But Buddy soon realizes that New York is nothing like the North Pole, and once again, he struggles to fit in.I found the film to be very enjoyable and entertaining. Will Ferrell was the perfect choice for Buddy, and you just can't help but laugh at the crazy things he does in New York. Eating gum off the sidewalk, attempting to use an escalator; the jokes are funny for children and adults alike. The ending is thrilling and kids will surely love it; adults likewise, despise some unnecessary sentiment thrown in. So overall, the movie is nothing spectacular, but it is a fun and refreshing Christmas comedy for the whole family.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2535107/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2535107,7," Not excellent, but a wonderful Christmas comedy nonetheless
","Before his first debut in the superhero genre starting with the first two Iron Man films, he directs a Christmas comedy known as ""Elf"" starring Will Ferrell and James Caan.It's about one of Santa's elves named Buddy who learns of his identity as a human and goes to New York City to find/meet his father and teach him the true meaning of Christmas in world of wacky cynics.As far as Christmas movies go, this one successfully details the Christmas feeling quite perfectly. The actors are brilliant. James Caan did a good job as Buddy's father, but I think that the best performance goes to Will Ferrell for his portrayal as Buddy and successfully gives out his hilarious comedic moments. The rest weren't that bad either especially Bob Newhart, Mary Steenburgen and Ed Asner. The jokes in this movie are hilarious including the ""He's an angry elf"" part and the directing from Jon Favreau was surprisingly good.My biggest complaint about this movie was the ending which felt too cheesy for my taste and in the third act, there were barely any jokes near the end of the film including it's atrocious dialogue, but I think the story was wonderful that boosts up the character development and it's not a complaint.Elf may not be excellent, but I'm sure it would be known to fans of Jon Favreau as a Christmas classic for children young and old.7.6/10","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2350243/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2350243,9," A great Christmas movie
","If this movie is not a Christmas classic by now, then it will be. Elf is the story about a human who was raised by elves, who finds out that he is human and goes to New York to find his dad.The story starts off great as Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is introducing us to who elves are and what they do in their lines of work, such as making shoes, baking cookies, or making toys at Christmas. Then it transitions to when Buddy was a baby at an orphanage who sneaks into Santa's sack while he is eating cookies. Later, Santa (Edward Asner) and his elves find a baby in the bag, who Papa Elf volunteers to raise.The story then focuses on Buddy being raised and trained to work like and elf, even though he can't keep up the pace with the other elves. He later realizes that he is a human and thinks about times when he does not fit. This makes Buddy decide to go to New York and find his dad, played greatly by the very talented James Caan.Will Ferrell stars as the human raised by elves named Buddy. Ferrell is great and shows many talents as a comedian and as an actor. You laugh at times when he is dumb because he does not know better. He also makes you feel for him at other times such as when he meets and likes a coworker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).As I said, Caan does a great job at his role as Walter Hobbs. He knows that Buddy is a grown man, but knows that he needs to get to reality, even though he loves Christmas. As for the rest of the supporting cast, Mary Steenburgen does a fine job for her part as Emily, Walter's wife. Daniel Tay does a great job at being very believable as Michael, Buddy's half-brother. You can understand what he's thinking when he first meets Buddy. Deschanel is wonderful as Buddy's love interest, Jovie. What Deschanel does great as Jovie is making her to be this girl who just wants to get through Christmas, yet she changes her ways after meeting Buddy.My favorite supporting players are the aforementioned Edward Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart as Papa Elf. I think so just because I enjoyed watching how great they naturally acted in their parts.The director of the movie is Jon Favreau. What Favreau does best with this movie is great storytelling that is fun for both kids and adults. I am 21 years old and I still enjoy watching this movie every year. Favreau proves how well he works with his cast, and make every part of the movie work and be fun. I enjoy seeing parts, such as Leon the snowman, as that makes me think about all those classic Christmas films like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.","

","When an SNL movie comes out, I always worry that it's going to have a few ""good bits"" in it but struggle as far as genuine narrative is concerned. Take ""LADIES MAN,"" for instance. ""ELF"", on the other hand, rocked. It's both genuinely funny and sweet. It does have two problems, however. I think if they had a second chance to do this movie, they would get rid of the ""gross bits""--the long Coca-Cola burp, the drunken mailrroom romp, the eating of used chewing gum--and play up the elfin stuff like the snowgunslingering, the bond between brothers, the Elf's really sweet tooth, his sweet infantile love for his father, and give us more of Bob Newhart's very touching Papa Elf. The second problem is the very weak, overly theatrical nonsense at the end with Santa's sleigh and the singing (off-key!)in the park. I know they needed to somehow conclude the movie, but that ending was childish--I think they lost the adults in the audience on that one. On the whole it is still a movie I watch every chance I get--I just shut it off right before the end.","

","I'm not usually a big fan of the sort of 'comedy' that Hollywood likes to put out, but this movie is GREAT! First, let me quickly sum it up. Buddy (Will Farrell) crawled into Santa's sack of gifts as a baby, and ended up being raised at the North Pole and working in Santa's toy shop. He's not near as good as making toys as the other elves, and one day he finds out he's actually human. With Santa's blessing, he makes his way to New York City to find his dad.Needless to say, his dad, Walter Hobbs (James Caan) isn't too thrilled to be confronted by an apparently delusional guy claiming he's his son. Walter ends up having blood tests done, and Buddy is really his son. Then he makes efforts to integrate him into both his family and his work place, with often hilarious results.All right, enough with the summary, you can find that anywhere! This movie is FABULOUS, and I usually despise anything to do with Will Farrell or Christmas. His acting in this movie is just perfect - Buddy wanders around with a perpetually curious, excited, dreamy sort of expression, and comes up with the most gut-busting things to say, all with a perfectly straight face.The rest of the family (Mary Steenburgen as Emily and Daniel Tay as Michael) are great and perfectly believable. I usually don't even like the kids in family movies like this, finding them either nauseatingly sweet or horrifyingly ill-mannered, but I really enjoyed Michael. And poor Walter - he's in a good but often difficult job, and overseen by a tyrant control-freak boss we don't meet until fairly close to the end of the film. A small mention to Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), since she was fairly good, but I wasn't as fond of her character as I could have been.Bottom line - the acting in this movie is brilliant, and it's pretty much non-stop laughs. I really only have one complaint about this movie - I suppose it's to be expected, but I really could have done without the sickly-sweet ending. It could have been worse, but I found the scene with everyone singing to bring Santa's sleigh up to the proper flying height to be really annoying. Other than that, though - I just CANNOT get over how funny and totally re-watchable this movie is!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1766279/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1766279,9," An amazing Christmas movie that should not be missed
","""Elf"" is one of the most inspiring Christmas movies you will find. Its entertaining and shows what true Christmas spirit is all about. Christmas is the most magical holiday to celebrate and Will Ferrell is the perfect elf to share that spirit. His character Buddy thinks ""the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear."" Buddy starts as a small boy who lives with nuns because his mother abandoned him. When Santa slips down the chimney on Christmas Eve he crawls into the bag. Buddy is taken to the North Pole, and that is how he became an elf.Even though Buddy was two or three feet taller than the rest of the elves, no one had the heart to tell him he wasn't really an elf. Santa is all about accepting people how they are, whether you are on the naughty list or the nice. Buddy decides he wants to meet his real family so he travels to New York City. Upon meeting his father there is instant tension. Will they ever learn to accept each other though? Buddy brings more Christmas spirit than his family could ever imagine. Will Ferrell is a natural performer as he gets in touch with his childish side. From lining the house with paper snowflakes to decorating a humongous Christmas tree in the living room, Buddy proves to be the true work of Santa Claus. Decorating and embracing the holiday season should not be a chore, and I think Buddy proves to his long lost family that they really need this spirit to show them the real meaning of Christmas. By decorating the house like the North Pole he helps them realize what he sees all year round, thus bringing them a little closer to his ""other life."" Buddy's experience in New York is a very different than the North Pole he is used to, but is an accurate picture of what we would actually see. I think its important to keep the real places true to their appearance. When depicting the North Pole the producers can be very creative, however; I am glad that New York was portrayed as we know it. By keeping it the same it gives the movie a more realistic setting with a fun North Pole twist.The scenery is incredible throughout the entire movie. Starting with the North Pole and all its wonders the story then moves to New York City. Buddy walks the streets of the city in his picturesque elf suit, complete with hat and elf shoes. Various scenes throughout the movie are decked out with twinkling lights, fluffy snow, shiny wrapping paper, and all eight reindeer. Watching this movie I realized how magical Christmas really looks. Everyone has their own way of decorating, but it all comes back to the classic Christmas symbols.The biggest theme in this movie is family. When Buddy goes missing, his father has to look deep inside himself to realize that finding his slightly abnormal son is more important than his job. Also, just because Buddy has found his birth father it doesn't mean that he has forgotten Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) who raised him. It is important to not forget everyone who loves you, family or not, during the holiday season.The music in this movie is very uplifting. Hearing all of the singing makes you want to sing along. All of the scenery is inspiring; resembling a winter wonderland. There are all the classic Christmas decorations. Toy trains running around Lego sculptures, cotton strewn about the floor, and a giant red velvet chair for Santa to sit in. The entire scene put together with music, decorations, and family will bring a smile to anyone's face.No good movie would be complete without a fairy tale ending. This is the best elf journey with a splash of Christmas spirit movie you will find to watch this holiday season. Between little elf characters and adult puns it is sure to be fun for the whole family to watch again and again.","

","OK, for the most part the movie was somewhat corny. Here it is, Will Ferrell is playing a guy named Buddy that believes he's an elf. Even though it is rather obvious that he is a LOT bigger than every other elf, he goes on believing it until the elf he referred to as ""dad"" broke it to him that he wasn't an elf. So began Buddy's journey out of the North Pole and to New York to find his real dad.Like I said, a lot of the movie was just corny, but I'll be darned if that guy Will Ferrell isn't a riot. Will Ferrell makes the ridiculous work, he was the perfect cast for the role. I just know that the movie doesn't have the same lustre or appeal with someone else in the role of Buddy. There was hardly a scene that Buddy was in that wasn't funny. And I would watch the entire movie again just to hear him say, ""He's an angry elf,"" when referring to an irate midget. Priceless.","

","This is probably some of the best family fun I had seen in 2003. It was very funny, and perfect for your kids. The humor was silly and original and I think the script and plot were pretty well done. It may not look like the most original film, but it was VERY good and VERY original. It's different.The way Buddy got his name was so funny and the humor was just always delivered perfectly by Walter, Buddy, Michael, and I also found Jovie pretty funny as well since she was always being sarcastic. The movie is also pretty surprisingly heart warming as well. Not your average Christmas flick. This one was really good.I definitely recommend Elf for the whole family because it is hilarious family fun!Bad language: Very minor Violence: Just a small part where Buddy gets beat up by a midget(HILARIOUS!)Clean family fun!","

His elf uniform is hilarious, and kids love it just as much. This wont ruin their belief in Santa, it might even make you believe ; ) it might get a little sappy at the end, but well worth the hour and a half to watch. you can watch this movie over and over and over and still laugh every time. i would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to laugh a lot : ) ""The toilet is ginormous!!""","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1543104/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1543104,7," A Modern Holiday Classic
","Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures (at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them (including Mike Myers).""Elf"" is destined to be a holiday classic, one of those you watch every year around the holiday season. Ferrell, a human baby adopted by elves (some scenes of him with his elf dad, played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart, provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags), goes off in search of his real father, a search that takes him to NYC. The joke of course is that Ferrell, wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings, doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY, where people are used to crazies, and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway.He finds his dad (played by James Caan), falls in love (with Zooey Deschanel) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit. It's all very funny and harmless, with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics (like me) who watch ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and root for the Grinch.Favorite line, delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house: ""This reminds me of the North Pole, except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me."" Grade: A-","

","Elf is one of those Christmas movies that you can't help but love. You don't have to be a fan of Will Ferrell to find this movie irresistible, mainly because it's so innocent. It's refreshing that Ferrell's first major studio film (next to Old School)after leaving the comforts of Saturday Night Live can be so appealing to all ages. 'Elf' never fails to make me laugh. To this day I get hysterical at the sight of a cotton ball. It's a film that's not intended to be Oscar worthy or thought provoking. 'Elf,' in all its hilarity helps us to see that life isn't as serious as we make it out to be and that the meaning of Christmas is completely forgotten when we allow the holidays to stress us out. It mayseem a deep meaning for such a farcical film, but the bottom line is,this movie just makes me feel good. It gives me an hour and half of good natured humor that never has to be censored and never fails to bring a smile to my face. So for those of you who dwell on this movie's ""flawed ending,"" I say look and see if instead of pointing out the bad, you can see the good in 'Elf.' Enjoy the keen sense of Christmas Spirit. After all, that's what Buddy would do.","

But after the movie ended my Christmas spirit was higher than ever almost. I think its a really good Christmas movie and Will Ferrell does some really good acting, and is so wonderfully cheerful. The only minus in my book is that Santa seems kinda grouchy and doesn't look that happy and plump as one would expect.

","Elf is another family film featuring Will Ferrell. Ferrell is Buddy, an elf raised by Santa's elves in the North Pole. Buddy lives with the elves thinking he is one of them until Papa Elf decides that he is old enough to know the truth. Buddy, after learning that his mother had died and his father did not know that he was alive, sets out for New York City to find his father.Buddy's father is played by the legendary James Caan and he is perfect for his role. Buddy finds that his father, Walter, is not as jolly as he had hoped. In fact the man has made the naughty list from Santa. Family is second to Walter and Buddy is third. Buddy's innocence and carefree view towards life is the only way to loosen up Walter and let the family have its first enjoyable Christmas. Will Ferrell goes along way from his adult comedy in Anchorman to a family film. He is carefree and at a few times you may thinks he's a complete idiot. But his jolliness defines how Christmas should be to family, a togetherness and unity during the holiday times. James Caan brings the same tough guy role to his father role, being the big man in a different way. He doesn't see the importance of family as much as money. His acting is fair with some great transitions around Ferrell, the scene when he convinces Buddy to go work in the basement with the criminals maybe his best acting in the film. As for the story. It's your typical fish-out-of-water story with a happy ending that is always expected. The scenes in North Pole are fantastic, putting the sort of magic behind the time of Christmas. THis film is going to be one Christmas movie to remember. It brings out a sense of importance of family, unity, and brings back what it is like to be a kid.Elf. Starring: Will Ferrell, James CaanBob Newhart, Edward Ashner, and Daniel Tay.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.","

In fact, this is the only role I like Ferrell in. Pleasant viewing for those who like a modern fairy tale.SPOILERS. Born to a single mom, baby Buddy was placed in an orphanage, and one Christmas night, while Santa (Ed Asner) was eating a cookie, crawled out of his bed and into Santa's toy sack. Upon discovery when Santa got back to the North Pole, Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) raised Buddy, who was quite larger than the other elves.

And those of you who went looking for Saturday night live on celluloid, I'm sorry.  Instead, this is a charming holiday movie with some silliness and some warmth.  Take a date, take the kids, and enjoy this film that gets you in the spirit.","

","It filled me with childlike joy. Perhaps my state of mind was slightly twisted at the time, but I REALLY enjoyed this movie. Having seen 'A Night At The Roxbury' a countless amount of times I was initially a bit disappointed at the the similarity between both of Will's characters. After five minutes I didn't care as I was too busy laughing. It's silly, childish, sweet and above all - funny. The naivety of the central character is perfectly balanced to provide children with plenty to relate to and adults with plenty to laugh about. Despite being 25 I found myself in the former category! As with the majority of Christmas films, it's delivered with a thick coating of candy, but that's what a lot of kids need. Believe in the magic of Christmas, if only for 95 minutes. If you can't do that, just laugh at the brilliant performance delivered by Will Ferrell. Certainly worth watching.","

","I was disappointed in this movie simply because it wasn't a comedy.  It was just a simple kid/family movie about a naïve if not slightly retarded man who thinks he's an elf.  Even in a movie about Santa, the leaps that Cann's character and Elf's girlfriend made by the end of the movie were unbelievable.  Why would a pretty blonde like that even talk to an elfin retard who can't figure out an escalator? If you're going to throw the sap around, at least make it somewhat believable. This disappointing movie contains exactly TWO laughs.  The first occurs early when they explain that elves can only do three jobs (shoe repair, cookie maker, Santa worker) and shows the hazards of putting an oven in an oak tree. The second, is when elf tries to top the tree with a star using a couch as a trampoline.  Other then this, the movie is just shallow entertainment for kids under the age of ten. Don't go in to this movie looking for a comedy.","

","I laughed more watching this movie than perhaps any other.  For the first 2/3rds of the movie I was laughing almost continuously and I don't think there was a scene with Will Ferrell in it where I didn't laugh out loud. I almost wet my pants several times. Fortunately there were only four other people in the cinema (surprising since it was the opening weekend), and they didn't seem to mind me busting a gut.I heartily recommend for other Ferrell/snl fans.  Both the physical comedy and dialogue were of top-notch hilarity.  I even almost cried a couple of times (and not just from laughing).  See for yourself.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875666/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875666,9," The Moose Hole - Review of Elf
","Christmas seems to be arriving earlier every year. Halloween and Thanksgiving are now the forgotten holidays as stores and businesses strum up garland and other holiday decorations in order to prepare for the hopefully fruitful shopping season ahead. The movie industry must be thinking the same thing starting this year especially after the success of last year's The Santa Clause 2, which opened the first weekend of November to nearly $30 million. New Line offers up their pre-holiday treat entitled Elf, which features the former Saturday Night Live comedian Will Ferrell, who has recently become a new rising star in Hollywood. After the dismal first half of the year with flops like A Man Apart and The Real Cancun, the studio bounced back in the second half with Freddy vs. Jason, Secondhand Lions, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and hopes to continue the trend until their mega-success The Return of the King opens near Christmas. Can Elf do that? If it's anything like The Santa Clause 2, it easily could but the Ferrell's comedy faces a lot more competition then Allen's did. Not only does the film open up against The Matrix Revolutions, the yuletide feature goes head to head with the highly publicized The Cat in the Hat and Disney's The Haunted Mansion later this month. Until then the film will have to build up pretty good word of mouth for it to still hear cash registers ringing come Christmas Day, let alone Thanksgiving.The story focuses a larger then usual elf who learns he is actually a human and travels to New York City to find his father. Up at the North Pole, elves are busy getting ready for Christmas but there is one elf that is learning that he doesn't quite fit in. Buddy is not the typical elf, his large size being the biggest factor. He eventually finds out from his adoptive father that he is actually a human that as an orphan baby climbed into Santa's gift bag one Christmas Eve and found his way to Santa's Workshop. After learning his true origin, Buddy travels to New York City to meet his father and be part of a real family. But this is easier said then done as his father is a real Scrooge and is prominently found on the naughty list. Buddy, who has never been to the human world, is unfamiliar with many of the things we are accustomed to like revolving doors and food products that don't include sugar. The unusually happy elf must find a way to change his father's workaholic attitude and help his new family find the true Christmas spirit. The story for Elf, though on the predictable side especially as the feature starts to wind down, works surprisingly well. This happens mostly in part to Ferrell's performance but there are also plenty of moments that come off as hilarious even without the lead starsThough the feature doesn't have an exceptionally large cast, the film doesn't have to with some lead characters picking up any slack left over by that. Will Ferrell, who was featured earlier this year in the hit comedy Old School, once again proves he has as much comedic timing and talent as he ever did on Saturday Night Live and probably even more so. Ferrell is able to make Buddy the elf both lovable and hilarious without pushing the personality of the character too far as to make him annoying and pathetic. James Caan, who takes on the role of Buddy's real father, has the grizzly workaholic business man down pat. The only problem lied not with Caan's performance but the character itself in how quickly the character changed his attitude at the end without really having a change-of-heart experience. And a big highlight came from the performance of legendary comedian Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father. Newhart looks like he had a lot of fun with this role and gives a delightful performance that many will remember despite being only a supporting character rather then a lead.Overall, Elf joins the ranks of such holiday features as The Santa Clause and Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas that shows Hollywood is still able to make a yuletide classic as good as the old days. It's the wonderful atmosphere and Will Ferrell's exuberant performance that makes this film a delightful treat for the whole family can enjoy without one member of the family being alienated by certain material. There are relatively few complaints that can be made about comedy. The only one that is prominent in most minds would be that film tends to be bit predictable at the end of the feature but the filmmakers pull it off so well that many write it off and they should. The slightly-predictable ending shouldn't ruin the overall amusement and delightfulness that the rest of the film presented up to that point. Ferrell's over-the-top performance should be a decisive enough reason to venture to the local movie theater and see Elf but if you are not truly convinced, here may be a better reason: Elf will keep the children busy for an hour and a half while the parents do their Christmas shopping. Smart, huh?!My Rating: **** ½ out of 5 (Grade: A-)","

","As an absolute non-fan of Will Ferrell's comedy, I was dragged kicking and screaming to this movie, so my enjoyment of it came as a huge surprise. Turns out it's more of an adult movie than a child-pleaser, and some good jokes were lost on my 11-yr-old daughter (though she loved the World's Longest Burp). There were some very funny bits, but my greatest delight came from James Caan as the straight man in this script -- after I saw him a completely phoned-in goon in ""Mickey Blue Eyes"" a few years ago, I never wanted to see him again, but he was terrific in ""Elf"". Peter Dinklage is dynamite as a very full-of-himself bestselling author. And Will Ferrell was cast so perfectly that I thoroughly enjoyed him, too. Yes, it's schmaltzy, but hey -- it's Christmas; the timing is perfect. 8/10","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875660/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875660,8," Best Crimbo movie in years!
","The first lead outing for Will Ferrell is a rare thing for modern times. A nice Christmas film with some real Christmas spirit that is also genuinely good. It has the right balance of being nice and festive while also being funny. Recent years have seen a depressing lack in good Christmas movies, with many just being straight to video or being too childish, like The Grinch. At Christmas time we should have Christmas movies. They have dried up though and when you look at Christmas TV listings there is a big lack there. True most are not very good but the best ones should be shown.Elf is funny and charming. It's a nice, if derivative story. Seasonal films can rarely be all that original though. Elf however is better than most and has added in a few original touches. Will Ferrell is superb, he's full of energy, he has charm and I can see a great future for him. While seasoned SNL veteran's like Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are faltering, Will is just launching himself and it looks like he could be a good leading man to rival the likes of Jim Carrey. He's a great comedian and a superb physical comic too. James Caan is good too and so is Mary Steenburgen but Ferrell absolutely steals the show.I look forward to Ferrell's future work and I think I may have to hire out Old School as well. ***1/2","

","I had to be talked into seeing this, but in the end it was a very worthwhile experience. It has probably been well over 10 years since I saw a ""G"" rated film that wasn't animated. I won't risk putting in any spoilers, but let's just say that there were a number of scenes that made me wonder how this film achieved a ""G"" certificate. This was a surprisingly sophisticated film, and I'm sure it will surprise no-one to learn that Will Ferrell carries the whole thing. The important thing is that he carries it extremely well. Its a standard ""fish out of water"" comedy, but well executed. Ferrell's intensity strikes a nice balance between mania and insanity, although he occasionally crosses the line as when he hissed at a department store ""Santa"" that he ""sat on a throne of lies"".The supporting cast did well, doing as they should: stand aside and let Ferrell do his thing. Nevertheless, there was some nice performances there too. James Caan, playing Buddy's biological father, showed a lot of skill as the Straight Man. He got one of the biggest laughs of the film when he was all by himself, opening a present from Buddy.Andy Richter and Kyle Gass made some brief, but hilarious, appearances.","

","'Elf' is without a doubt the best movie -- and certainly the best family movie -- to come out in a very long time.  Although I very much enjoyed ""Master and Commander"" (far more than I expected to), 'Elf' is by far a better film.  Okay, perhaps I shouldn't compare since they are two entirely different kinds of story, but given a choice to see either again sooner, I'd choose Elf.  I cannot find words to describe what an increbibly pleasant surprise Elf proved to be.  Very well- and smartly-written.  There were many points in the story where they could have gone in any of several wrong directions but instead chose the right one.  This movie is (for lack of less-overused words) very heartwarming and touching.  Good (and relatively minimal) special effects, some good action, and an abundance of laughs.  Movies haven't honestly earned that much laughter from me in quite some time.  The performances were well-executed. James Caan was perfectly cast for his character, and Amy 'Strangers with Candy' Sedaris has a pleasantly light-hearted supporting role to Caan's. In particular, Will Ferrell's performance was spot-on, maintaining just the right level of earnest child-like innocence and skillfully avoiding going over the top or descending into mere clownishness.  A well-chosen soundtrack, some clever pop culture references and a well-crafted opening credits sequence round out this wonderful flim.","

","*some spoilers*Walking into the theater earlier today I expected Elf to be a funny, entertaining movie. I could never have excpected what was to follow. Not only is this a brilliant script with excellent direction, but Will Ferell is perfect as the role of Buddy the elf. The movie opens with a creative inroduction, using ideal narration to catch the viewer up on buddy's story. As a young boy, Buddy is at an orphanage because his mother had put him up for adoption and died several days later. His father never knew of his son. On Christmas Eve, Buddy is awakened when Santa comes down the chimney to deliver presents to the orphanage. The curious young Buddy crawls into Santa'a sack, and is brought back and raised as a Elf. Many years later, he sets out on a journey to find his real father, and to live life as the human he really is. What follows is a hilariously entertaining, wild romp as Buddy's story folds out at the absolute perfect pace, thanks to director Jon Favreau. Also tied into the story are a girl Buddy finds himself interested in, an angry vertically-challenged author working at his dad's publishing company, and a catastrophoc failure of Santa's sleigh engina, which only Buddy can fix. This is an amazing holiday movie for the whole family. Only Scrooge himself could dislike such a heartwarming, brilliant film.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875593/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875593,9," Great Family Film!
","I found Elf an enjoyable film, especially since I saw it with my family. It's a perfect family film, as I stated in the one-line-summary, but I wouldn't choose it for a person who loves comedy and all comedy.You'd find somethings corny, such as when Jovie sings, and everyone turns around at once in order to join her. First of all, why does every movie recently made have to have a love interest for a main character in it? It's not like the film wouldn't have gone on without her. The film is a family film, for gods sake! (But it's not like she ruined the whole film either.)One thing I respect about the film, though, is Will Ferrell's acting. He is the type of an actor who could play any character or genre, and be very good with it. I found him surprisingly good at being ""Buddy"", a jolly ""little"" elf, although his jokes were often based for younger kids (Though I laughed at certain ones.)At first I felt kind of awkward about seeing Will Ferrell as a children's character, basing this on his former acts on SNL, but he turned out very funny and sort of adorable.Overall, this film is very enjoyable. If you are looking for pure comedy, skip this one. But if you're looking for a heart-warmingly (not a real word) funny movie, go catch at the nearest theater with your friends and family. I gave 9 for it's childish-yet-funny like comedy.","

","The movie was a an unexpected surprise.  The theatre was packed and everyone was rolling on the floor.  This movie elicits more than a few chuckles and snickers - nothing less than full blown brings-tears-to-your-eyes laughs. I have to give special kudos to Will Ferrell (he finally broke away from the bland, boring, lackluster writing at SNL)to show that he does have his own considerable comedic chops - without him this film would not have been half as good.  I also give thumbs-up to Bob Newhart, who played Farrell's elf mentor and looks his most pained when giving Farrell a heart-to-heart talk on his elf-sized lap.  It was good to see Bob still has his deadpan timing. Edward Asner was also up to the mark with his protrayal of Old Saint Nick. Everyone in the film and out seemed to be enjoying themselves. This is definitely an adult/child crossover movie (like Shrek)that can appeal to both groups simultaneously.  I recommend it to help limber up those so seldom used laugh muscles.","

I usually love fish out of waterstories and I have always loved watching Wil Farell on SNL so Ithought even though this appeared to be a kiddy film I thought I'dgive it a shot. I think there were a lot of good ideas and the idea ofa 6'2 elf walking around New York City to me is just funny, but asanother comment pointed out; Buddy seemed to adapt to hissurroundings WAY too easily and quickly. He won everyone over inlike a minute. He found a girlfriend, won over his father and gainedthe respect and love from everyone with way too much ease. I alsofound it bizzarre that the reason he did not fit in in elfland wasbecause he was so inept, however his amazing skills at buildingrocking horses and decorating beautiful christmas displays wouldprove otherwise. It didn't fit. It was kind of a Rudolph the red noseraindeer I suppose, but much less effective. I also felt the endscene with James Caan walking out of a career ending meetingbecause of Buddy was rediculous. Buddy had done nothing butinterfere and mess up his life so it didn't make sense that at thatparticular moment he'd forfeit his career for this man. I saw somany movies, Christmas and otherwise that were ripped off forthis movie and they were all 100 times better than this one.","

I really don't mean to insult all of you who've found this movie to be entertaining, but; you are all really easily amused.  This is simply not a funny movie.  Anything which could be counted as a joke can be seen coming as if it was a flaming asteroid about to hit Earth.  Will Ferrell is just not funny (not in this movie, anyway).  James Caan walks through his lines, Mary Steenburgen really has no lines worth saying, and Bob Newhart's portrayal of an Elf who doesn't show too much emotion only drags things down even more.  (MINOR SPOILERS) The story is inconsistent: Buddy's character has a particular reputation regarding his performance as a toymaker in the North Pole, but in Manhatten he displays the opposite qualities.  James Caan wants Buddy out of his life forever, yet completely changes his mind moments later for some feeble reason given by his son: ""Buddy was right"" or some such nonsense.There are a couple of laughs but out a whole professionally produced movie, they are not nearly enough to carry the day.  Director Favereau has done far better work.  What happened here isn't clear.  One high point, though, is Zooey's lovely singing voice, especially during the credits with Leon Redbone.Geez, I must sound like quite a Grinch, but if you've 12 or under and you've never seen anything else, perhaps this is a funny movie.

Its gotten sad when movies rated G, PG and up have to be screened before you can take your kids to see the movie because even G has some suggestive humor, or even a swear now and again.But this movie was language free... the worst thing said is Son of a nutcracker. there's not vulgarity- there's no sex- there is nothing but a thousand laughs (And a really good Lord of the Rings reference near the end.)the first ten minutes are a tad draggy, but once you get into the heart of the movie, its constant laughs. It will make you feel warm inside... you'll laugh till it hurts, and you don't have to be afraid of taking the whole family to see it.

","Elf is a thoroughly delightful holiday movie!  I expected it to be funny (thanks to Will Ferrell), but I didn't expect it to be so cute or heartwarming.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Elf delivers the Christmas spirit without too much syrup (figuratively that is, since actual syrup appears quite often in the movie!), and is directed by Jon Favreau in the style of the best holiday films (including adorable sets at the North Pole and the appearance of traditional stop-motion Christmas characters).Will Ferrell stars as Buddy, a naive and joyful (not to mention sugar-hyper) human adopted by one of Santa's helpers at a young age (many jokes are gleaned from his 6'4"" stature among the tiny elves).  At the age of 30, he heads to New York City to find his real father (played by James Caan), who appears, to Buddy's shock, on ""the naughty list.""  Hilarity ensues as Buddy adjusts to life in the big city, and everyone else in the cast adjusts to Buddy.Ferrell does an amazing job portraying Buddy.  Although Buddy is almost constantly hyperactive and could quickly wear on your patience, Ferrell imbues him with a childlike wonder and innocence combined with just the right dose of his usual crazy comic self.  The children and adults in the theater laughed at all the right places, and there was a collective silence at those parts that made your heart melt.The casting is inspired: James Caan, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart all play their roles straight and with conviction, while Zooey Deschanel shines (though she may possibly be too young to play opposite Ferrell?).  Cameos from a couple of offbeat comedians just sweetened the deal.I think this film could become another holiday classic, in the tradition of ""A Christmas Story"" (though it's not quite as universal to the human experience as that marvelous film).  All I know is that I walked out the theater full of the Christmas spirit and itching to see Elf again!","

Even the artwork in the opening credits showed the makers of the film understood what they were doing- they were embracing all the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials (Rudolph, Frosty,etc.)all the other cheesy Xmas movies and we were going to have FUN. Ferrell is a strong comic force and he is hilarious in the movie - he gives 100% and it pays off. Great to see comic legend Bob Newhart on the big screen and the visuals of Ferrell crushing Newhart's lap is priceless. Now, it is not a perfect movie of course - yes, near the end it kind of runs in place and spins it's wheels and Caan's complete character turnaround is fake - he changes just because it is time to change cuz the mvie needs to wind down. BUT, come on,folks, this isn't Terms Of Enderament or To Kill A Mocking bird, it's a holiday comedy ABOUT AN ELF!!!!! And for that and it's high concept premise, it really  works.

","I'm not usually one for opening night crowds, but I made an exception for this one.  My wife and I (In our mid-30s) brought my wife's sister (mid 20s) and our son (who is 10).  My wife laughed the hardest - to tears at a few points and for about a minute and a half after one joke.  I was second on the laugh-o-meter.  Our son laughed the least.  My sister-in-law laughs quietly, so it's hard to tell with her.  Lots of laughing in the packed theater, though.For about the last 20 minutes, the laughs stopped for me, but I didn't really mind because I needed a break as my belly hurt.  And there were some underdeveloped characters and relationships and a lot of nonsense.  But it is a comedy first and foremost and it delivers.There was nothing in it we wouldn't want our son to see, save for one scene with alcohol and a drunken Elf, but it was short.  So it's safe for the family, but we definitely enjoyed it more than our child.  I recommend seeing it in a crowded theater during a mid-evening show.  Our audience was a lot of fun and started singing along with the movie.It will be one of those movies on TV every Christmas and I will look forward to it every year.","

","It takes a pretty big pair of snowballs to release a Christmas movie this early in November.  The studio has to have enough confidence in their film that it will last at least to Christmas, which is more than a month and a half away.  After seeing ""Elf"", I understand why New Line was so confident.  ""Elf"" is destined to become a Christmas classic.  In the footsteps of Chevy Chase's Clark W.. Griswold III; and Bill Murray's Francis Xavier Cross, Will Ferrell's Buddy the Elf will be rerun for years to come on the Superstation for generations to enjoy.  I was skeptical at first that he could pull it off.  Where Eddie Murphy and Robin Williams have succeeded in making the leap to family films, others have failed.  Ferrell seems at his best when he can be a little raunchy and unpredictable.  His Frank the Tank in ""Old School"" was fantastic, but could he do the family thing?  Absolutely.  He has added another dimension to his acting, and this could prove to be a major turn in his career.  Also adding new dimension is John Favreau.  Favreau has made a career writng and directing films that are dialogue driven.  ""Made"" is one of the funniest films of the last decade, so for him to take on ""Elf"" must have been a harrowing decision.  He has eloquently captured the tone of what a good Christmas movie should be, and should be commended.  ""Elf"" also features great camp performances (which I will not spoil) and James Caan delivers his best performance since ""Bottle Rocket.""  A new Christmas classic is here, one that made this Grinch's heart grow large.","

","Of course, ""A Christmas Story"" is in a class by itself, as it's one of the best films ever made about growing up in America - not just a holiday flick. ""Elf"" is a more typical Christmas movie, just an unbelievably good one. I pity any other Christmas movies coming out this year; they will suck almost by default after this.The secret, I think, are director Jon Favreau's smart choices. He keeps Will Farrell and James Caan in character 101% of the time - he never allows them to comment on their characters in any way. Both play it absolutely straight and it works like a charm. Favreau also deserves some Golden Genius Award for casting Ed Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart - one of our national treasures - as Farrell's adopted Papa Elf. Both are priceless and will be long remembered for this movie.Favreau's other smart choice is to keep the length of most scenes very short; he gets in, gets the laugh and gets out. It's very easy for this type of movie to become embarrassing or even cruel for the ""special"" character at the center. Favreau knows this and never lets a scene drag on long enough for our amusement to turn to pity.As a film in general, ""Elf"" isn't important enough to rate more than a 7 or 8, but as a Christmas movie, it's a 10+.","

James Caan and Mary Steenburgen were their usual (consumate professional) selves.  Relative newcomers Daniel Tay and Claire Lautier are definitely going to get more film roles.  And, so will Zooey Deschanel (who does her own superb singing on the soundtrack)!  True; this was geared mostly for the seven-to-pre-teen demographic.  *There's even some light-hearted jabs at some of the Rankin/Bass classics.* So, the thirty-plus crowd might want to fake several trips to the rest room or the snack bar during the lamer (from a grown-up's p.o.v.) jokes.

It is no wonder he will now be invading movie screens 4-5 times a year.The film's story had the potential to be a sappy tearjerker that only small children would tolerate but Ed Asner and Bob Newhart's strong supporting performances save face for the adult audience.  Newhart's deadpan delivery is a perfect fit for a 450 year-old, single elf.  Asner delivers a great performance as Santa Claus.  James Caan makes a great Scrooge type character.So often a movies funniest scenes are revealed in the trailer; this is not the case with Elf.  Unlike the tedious filler placed between the weak gags in Scary Movie 3, Elf had an enjoyable mix of slapstick and plot driven humor.  Moviegoers were so caught up in the story that they were singing along during the film's finale.  There was even a round of applause for the enjoyable holiday treat.There is no deep meaning to this film so there is no need for a long-winded review.**** (out of 5)","

","Having just seen ""Elf"" I found myself wondering ""who would NOT like this movie""? It is so void of the usual self-indulgent ""irony"" of most of the crap comedies out there. There are no precocious kids uttering snap phrases or playing pranks to show what idiots adults are, no one stepping in dog-do, no un-funny gags or jokes that beg the question ""what were they thinking when they wrote this?"" I think it is the unique movie that is not made specifically for kids, but would be thoroughly enjoyed by them. Sure, the premise has been played out a million times (which one: the fish out of water, the innocent man-child who teaches all a lesson about being positive or seeming to be a genius in his naivete, the grump who sees the light about what's ""really important"" etc.) but in what a great way. Will Ferrell totally captures how a child comments and behaves on things he sees and just can't believe,  and what a lineup for the rest of the cast! Who knew Zooey Deschanel had such a great sexy voice? The duet in the Gimbel's bathroom is simply charming. Artie Lange as the ""fake"" Santa? (an ""Old School"" reunion of sorts!) And Amy Sedaris as the chirpy assistant to James Caan? Give the casting director a raise.The filmmakers obviously had a great time making this clever Christmas movie (the use of Etch-a Sketches is brilliant as are the Christmas decorations that Buddy makes)that leaves you with a grin on your face. If you are looking for existential film fare, this ain't it. And that's okay. You just can't help but enjoy this movie.","

","I loved ""The Santa Clause"" trilogy & bought this movie thinking it would be similar. It was NOT.Some of the worst scriptwriting & dialogue ever. Almost perverse in the way this supersized man wanted to hug, snuggle & play tickle games with every grown man he encountered. Will Ferrell was a real turn off in this movie. I would not want a child to see this movie.It is one thing that a human was raised by elves & was out of his element in the human world, but this human has the maturity level & IQ of a Turnip. He is an oversized, overgrown adult human behaving like a 5 year old who is rude, obnoxious, destructive and goes out of his way to insult & embarrass the other cast members. Let us also not forget he is running around in leotards and a short jacket. Quite disturbing.Even if he was elf sized, he would not be sitting in the adopted elf father's lap as a full grown adult. This depicts him as mentally unstable with an IQ of 50 & the mentality of a kindergartener in the body of a 40 year old man.He is rude, disruptive, does not follow instructions, attacks & insults people and destroys his fathers home to the point where he could not be left home alone. Frankly, any normal person would have had him committed to the asylum. He clearly had no business being out in public without someone to accompany him. It also made no sense that the elves would have allowed him to go alone to the human world with no traveling companion to chaperone him.This movie is offensive. Not funny. A terrible script & I hope to never see Ferrell again.If the script had cast the elf as a mature, intelligent 15 year old boy who was escorted by another elf to meet his human father, the story might have worked with a lot of behavior editing. This mentally deficient intellectually challenged, overgrown 40 year old in tights doing stupid things like eating cotton balls at the doctors office & pouring syrup on spaghetti & sending his father a negligee simply were not funny. These Jim Carey slapstick & 3 stooges style script was not amusing.Additionally, it is one thing for the human raised by elves to be disoriented with customs & surroundings; and quite another to behave like a loudmouth child with bad manners & mentally defective. It was like watching Lily Tomlin's ""Edith Ann"" character. Ferrell also made it worse by grossly overacting his childish behavior.This 6' 2"" forty year old human elf literally sat in his tiny adopted elf fathers lap, crushing him (this was a visual effect. I am referring to the visual concept of him sitting in the elf dad's lap at his age & size). Whether he was human or elf, he should have behaved his age instead of a Jim Carey version of Lily Tomlin's ""Edith Ann"".It was sickening. Clearly, the producers hired bloggers to artificially pump up their reviews.","

","This film is for those 8 and up. Elf makes a good Christmas season film. The film works well in January too in the winter weather. Elf will put a smile on your face. Will Ferrell makes a funny human elf. Bob Newhart makes a cute papa elf. The film can even make a good background movie while decorating the house for Christmas. It is a light hearted film and should entertain the whole family. String popcorn, eat popcorn, and make merry while watching this film. Buddy Elf tries so hard to fit into his new human family. It doesn't matter who you are, we are at least once in our lives, the new kid on the block. We learn to fit in and we desire acceptance and affection. For about an hour and 40 minutes the film will entertain you. Four thumbs up.","

","I realized that this movie had a lot of adult stuff in it, though kids can also enjoy this movie. Anyway, I liked this movie, and besides, Will Ferrell is a perfect person for this movie, because he's tall enough to be an ""abnormal elf/human."" Since elves only exist in our ""La-la Land,"" I guess makers of this film wanted to make this a comedies for adults, yet it has ideas that kids love which is one thing- elves. The languages in this movie was appropriate for adults, but it offends young children under 8 years old (you'll have to see the movie in order to find out, because I don't want give ANY examples). If you've gone to the official site for Elf, you'll see that some of the screen shots for this movie is interesting for children, though this movie has some humors that adults can handle. Also, seeing Will Ferrell as a human raised by elves makes me laugh ALL THE TIME. I love to see this movie again.","

","There are some Christmas songs that are just right and will be on every Christmas compilation album for 30 years. They'll be played on the radio every year for 30 years and people will listen to them/sing to them/dance to them at their work Christmas parties for 30 years. Well this is that but in a movie. The ingredients are right and like Home Alone, A Miracle on 34th Street and The Santa Clause it will be a long running favourite Christmas movie in my house for......probably 30 years. Why is everything 30 years? I don't know it's just an approximate number.The story follows Buddy the elf who after discovering he's actually a human but was adopted by elves travels to New York to find his real father. He fits in New York like a Terminator would fit in at a tea party, which makes for a lot of the laughs. Of course eventually the film moves on to being heartwarming, touching and even a little exciting. There's even a chance for Buddy to save Christmas before the movie is finished.This is another film where the acting is good allround and as I said earlier it has the right ingredients to make you feel good at Christmas time. Kids will love this film and most adults will enjoy it too.Definitely needs to be in your Christams movies collection.","

","I hate Christmas movies. Probably the only exception would be A Christmas Story, which does not have the schmaltz and smarmy faux Christmas cheer that are a stock in trade for just about every other Christmas movie that I've ever seen. And Elf is no exception, either. This movie just would not gel. There were a few funny scenes-mostly when Will Ferrell is turned loose and allowed to play his own brand of goofy, insane big kid shtick. But the movie has far too few of these scenes, and far too many 'heartwarming' ones. I believe the yardstick for this kind of crap is It's A Wonderful Life, a movie I despise with a whole hearted and sincere passion. Christmas seems to bring out this drivel in all filmmakers, making them revel in mawkish sentimentality and long soliloquies on 'the Christmas Spirit'. Elf had this in spades, especially with the forced last third of it. I never ,ever wanted to see James Caan 'converted' into a nice guy by love and the Christmas spirit. My gorge rose at that atrocious signing scene, where everyone was learning to believe in Santa Claus once again. Sickening. And the whole point is flawed, since shouldn't we learn to love each other all year round, not just once a year on a commercial driven holiday? And please don't talk to me about having the 'Christmas spirit' all year round. If i had the Christmas spirit all year round, I'd lock it in my basement and torture it with electrodes. To all filmmakers everywhere-please, please, PLEASE stop making inspirational Christmas tales. I'm begging you, just STOP.","

","I watched this mainly because of Zooey. She's beautiful and the scene where she's singing in the shower was the best scene in the film. The salute to the old classic puppetry animation Christmas specials near the beginning was superb. The snowball fight was pretty cool. There is quite a few scenes in this that had great potential. What's wrong with this film is simple. Casting Will Ferrell in the lead severely damaged what could have been a hysterical Christmas comedy. People are being overly nice to it because it's a holiday film. There is a lot of talent here; Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, even the kid is good. Unfortunately Will Ferrell wasn't any good. He isn't funny.I guess Jim Carrey cost too much or something. He was brilliant in The Grinch and in A Christmas Carol. He even worked with Zooey in Yes Man and their chemistry was right on the money. This should have starred Jim. Jim Carrey in the lead would have made the film much better and definitely much funnier.Anyway, to sum up, don't expect to laugh at Will unless your intent is to pass on sympathy for his unfunny performance since it is a holiday film.","

","I have very fond memories of when my family and I saw this movie in theaters in 2003 when I was only 7 years old. We quickly got it on VHS, and we have since watched it every year around Christmas time.Will Ferrell is a very hit-or-miss comedian, but he hits big time with this movie. He does a great job with the childlike aspect of his character, and his comedic timing and line delivery is just brilliant.We also have an excellent supporting cast consisting of James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Deschanel, and Peter Dinklage. The relationship between Buddy and his father is wonderfully played out and manages to be very touching. Santa, Emily, Michael, and Jovie were also great characters.This film also has a nice Christmas feel to it. It just really gets you in the mood for the holidays. The end scene with everyone singing ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and raising the Christmas spirit to make the sleigh fly always gives me the warm fuzzies.Funny, intelligent, and poignant, this film is everything I want in a Christmas movie. It's one I never grow tired of watching, and I can't recommend it enough.RATING: A+","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3539545/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw3539545,5," Needed More Time In The Workshop
","Can a real Christmas movie get made in our cynical, charm-free 21st century? Probably not, if ""Elf"" is the best stab at it so far.Up in the North Pole, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) discovers he isn't an elf at all, but a displaced human orphan who found his way into Santa's bag at the end of a busy Christmas and was then raised in Santa's workshop. He undertakes to reconnect with his biological father, Walter Hobbs (James Caan), a gruff Manhattan executive who has found his way on Santa's naughty list.Odd to step back in time and see Will Ferrell in this early starring role, playing so resolutely to PG sensibilities that he almost seems made of gingerbread. Unless you own Keebler stock or have an aversion to watching spaghetti being eaten with maple syrup, there's little here to offend you.Alas, ""Elf"" is a film that thinks it's way cuter than it actually is. The idea of hearkening back to the stop-action TV Christmas shows I grew up with back in the 1970s is pleasant enough, and so is seeing NYC all dolled up for the holidays. But the story is a one-joke premise stretched well past its limit: Ferrell doing his man-child thing wearing an elf suit in the big city.One sequence demonstrates for me the limited nature of the film. In it, a children's book author played by another future big star, Peter Dinklage, comes to Caan's publishing house office to help concept an idea. Buddy spots him and immediately calls to him as a fellow elf, thus sparking a WWF rumble in the conference room.Sure, Dinklage is a little person and so the joke gets a bit of a laugh, but not anything to build deeper humor from. Why not, since we know Buddy is an overgrown kid, move past that and have the two get into a spirited disagreement about kiddie fiction, or what weather conditions are like on the North Pole? Instead, it's a short joke, some mayhem, and then cue the next scene.The film has a lot of go-nowhere moments like that, whether it's Buddy getting mistaken for a store employee at Gimbel's or Buddy's stop-motion pals on the North Pole. Caan deserves credit for playing his part with a deft lightness I wasn't expecting, and indeed most of the supporting work is fun. I especially enjoyed Bob Newhart as an especially sedate elf who looks after Buddy.There are also some funny bits for fans of Ferrell's wilder roles. Watching Buddy get into it with a department-store Santa (Artie Lange) who he accuses of being a fraud (""You sit on a throne of lies!"") is good for a few laughs, even if it devolves into another rumble. Zooey Deschanel is sweet as Buddy's left-field romantic interest, and the ending actually manages to be rousing, shot as it was literally in the ashes of 9/11.But manipulation is kind of at the heart of this film, both when it's working and when it's not. For all his evident good taste and desire to please, director Jon Favreau seems at a loss when it comes to finding that next gear and giving ""Elf"" a sense of wonder or of mission. It's pleasant and light, and often amusing, but still leaves you with the feeling of a misfit toy.","

","I watched this film last night because I saw its high ratings and thought it might be kind of funny to watch over the holidays. But oh my god, it was terrible! Not only is it full of that hokey happy-joy Christmas cr*p, it also astonishes me how the hell it ever got a G-rating. It's got everything from fart jokes to the main character pulling his pants down to trolls getting drunk to swearing. Yeah yeah, I know some people find crude humor to be hilarious (society is failing), but I think crude humor is disgusting and it really makes a movie a hassle to watch when you have to endure loads of nasty jokes and things you don't want to see. It's just my opinion, like it or leave it, if you think I'm being too harsh on this movie then that's up to you. Maybe I sound like a prudish old lady or something but I'd rather be a prude than an ignorant, rude pig who gets a kick out of fart sounds and pervy jokes in movies.I thought the plot was somewhat creative, but nothing to deserve the rating it has. The acting wasn't very good at all (yeah, sorry if I've offended all you Will Ferrel fanatics out there). The soundtrack was trashy and cheap, completely unoriginal, and I've already called up my mom and dad to thank them for not showing me this when I was a little kid (back in 2003 when it first came out). PARENTS, DON'T LET YOUR KIDS VIEW THIS GARBAGE. Stick with The Polar Express or A Charlie Brown Christmas. At least those movies can be funny and creative without being too cheesy and stupid!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2731167/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw2731167,7," Elf — A goofy holiday comedy to bring you cheer
","Elf has an interesting premise: a human baby raised by North Pole elves and Santa Claus. The goofy twist to the story fits perfectly with Will Ferrell's acting style. He is just silly enough in a straight and earnest way to make you believe the whole rigamarole.Every new development in the scenario gives the opportunity for more laughters, and the presentation of new aspects of the elf society.The acting, editing, and special effects are simple and well crafted, nothing to detract from enjoying the spectacle.It's a great recommendation if you're looking for Christmas related entertainment.","

","This movie is great! It's good-natured, funny, and gives us some Christmas spirit. Elf is set in the present day, so technology is the same as it has always been. It also gives a nice complement to Scripture by showing us that Christmas is not about receiving, but giving. Although it never truly gives a reference to the Bible, it has a good message and is not sending people a wrong one. I highly recommend this movie because it's just downright hilarious! It's become such a classic when Christmas time is around. Everyone should watch this movie because the main character, Buddy, shows us how to be filled with Christmas spirit and how to always want to help others and not just ourselves.","

","Since its almost thanksgiving, its that time in November were I start watching all my traditional holiday films. Elf without a doubt is one of them. Hard to believe this movie is 9 years old already. I laughed watching it when I was a kid, and I'm still laughing just as hard today. This movie got so creative with the humor, slapstick, puns, lines, this is literally my favorite Christmas film next to Its a Wonderful Life. Will Ferrel was perfectly casted as Buddy the Elf, a heart loving Christmas elf from the north pole who finds out he's actually a human being who was raised by elves after he snuck into Santa's toy bag at an orphanage when he was a baby. The plot was just fantastic, and was thought thru well. The movie teaches a very valuable lesson, do what you love in life, don't let others stand in the way of that ever, and that you should always be yourself. The movie shows the great relationship between a father who doesn't believe his son is an elf from the north pole, but accepts him the way he is in the end. Many can learn the true meaning of Christmas, as well as life lessons in this holiday classic. This is another holiday film that will live on for the years to come.","

","Elf is one of the better Christmas movie I have seen. The only movies associated with Christmas that are better than this are the first two Home Alone movies. This is nothing Oscar-worthy but it is a feel-good holiday film. I think Will Ferrell is an mediocre actor at best but I feel this is his best role.This is about a human who was raised in the Arctic by Santa and the elves. When he is thirty, he ventures out to find his real dad. Unfortunately for Buddy, his dad seems to have no interest in having him as a son.The acting is pretty good. I mentioned Ferrell before and I am surprised on how I actually liked him. The older guys like James Caan, Edward Asner, and Bob Newhart were wonderfully cast.Overall, this is a fantastic Christmas tale. It's definitely the best one this century so far. I rate this film 9/10.","

","Why is British Christmas TV so damned depressing?There is an annual Yuletide Cull in all our favourite soaps,characters we have let into our homes for months or years get raped,pillaged,bludgeoned or stabbed or emotionally destroyed with indecent haste over a four day period,leaving us rubbing our eyes with disbelief.Of all the Christmas Specials only ""The Royle Family"" was even vaguely uplifting.As Jim Royle would say,""Happy Christmas - my ar*e!""So in desperation I scoured ""Radio Times""(other listings magazines are available)for a movie to get me out of the slough of despond.""Santa Claus - the movie"" lasted 10 minutes,a multitude of ""Chrismas Carol"" clones had me reaching for the Amontillado.""A matter of life and death""?A fine movie but hardly likely to warm the cockles of my heart........""Elf""?Never heard of it.With nothing to lose except my taste for mince pies I turned to Filmfour as I have so often done more in hope than anger before.Bingo!! ""Elf"" is 100% a Christmas movie.It has elves in it(honest!),reindeer,some cute North Pole creatures including a wonderfully surreal narwhal that pops its head out of the water to say farewell to Buddy(Mr W.Ferrell) as he leaves on his Odyssey to the Big Apple. Chief amongst the elves is the wonderfully laconic Mr B.Newhart - remembered with affection by my generation for his brilliantly inventive one - sided telephone conversations.His is the voice - over that helps the story move along. What I loved most about ""Elf"" was its unremitting optimism,its belief in the inherent decency of mankind despite all the evidence to the contrary not only in 2003 but even more so today. It has all the wonder and innocence of childhood and the deeply - held conviction that we lose rather than gain wisdom as we grow older. Mr J.Caan,splendid as Buddy's natural father, is a deeply suspicious man totally unable to accept his newly - acquired son at face value.Miss M.Steenburgen - perhaps more in touch with her inner child - has an immediate empathy with him.Here is an actress who has grown more beautiful and honest as she has got older. With all the best bits from many earlier Christmas movies lovingly embedded,""Elf"" is a pure pleasure for adult or child. Together with its diametric opposite,""Scrooged"",it will certainly play at my house for many Christmasses to come,and as far as I'm concerned the BBC can go and jump for their licence fee next year.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1947613/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1947613,9," Great For the Christmas Season...
","I absolutely enjoyed Elf far more than I could ever have predicted. From the acting, the tone, and overall story, this is definitely great for those who are in love with the Christmas season.Will Ferrel's portrayal of Buddy the elf is one of his more definitive characters that the audience can actually relate to -- unlike Ricky Bobby or Ron Burgundy. Bob Newhart's screen time is too short to really comment on, but his total of 15-minutes are very good. Zooey Deschanel is a gorgeous actress and her performance really adds a more mellow tone to the otherwise more energetic Ferrel.The ""fish out of water"" concept is easily recognizable, such as with Big, but Elf is far more than that, as our main character not only seeks a father figure, but also acceptance. The writing is very good, and the comedy never falls flat, be it slapstick or not. The direction by Jon Favreau is slightly simple, yet every scene works and none falter, which awards him a nice applause.The music aside, there's not much to comment on on that particular subject, as it has a lot of the twinkles and jingles of the vast majority of other Christmas-themed films.Overall, I highly recommend Elf to any family looking for a film to watch on a cold, winter night, with a hot cup of cocoa, as the vibe is nothing but positive and rewards the viewer with a greater sense of morale.","

But it seems Hollywood finally got it right with ""ELF"".One thing I noticed about Elf is it's overflowing with Charm, wit and humor something that reminds me of that ""other"" ""christmas story"". It's script is memorable, the direction is tight and the acting is flawless. Will Ferrell should have received some kind of recognition for his performance. He bring's this big lovable Elf to life like no other actor could. He own's this role. All in all, Elf succeeds...more than i expected and brought a big smile to my face.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1623530/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1623530,5," A Funny Holiday Film
","Elf is fun, but flawed no matter which way you look at itPlot: When he was a baby, Buddy (Will Ferrell) accidentally crawls into Santa's bag one Christmas Eve. Flash forward a couple of years and Buddy is now an adult. He has been raised as a elf and nobody has ever told him he is human. Buddy is constantly worrying about belonging to the elf's, but can't seem to do anything right. One day his elf dad (Bob Newhart) tells him the truth and Santa (Edward Answer) sends him to New York City to find his dad, Walter Hobbs (James Caan). He learns his dad has lost his Christmas faith and is mean and bossy. He goes to live with his wife, Emily (Mary Steenburgen) and her son, Michael (Daniel Tay). He gets a job at Gimbel's and falls in love with Jovie (Zooey Deschanel). Promlems arise as kids across the world are starting to lose their Christmas faith.The Good News: This film actually made me laugh hysterically and not just once, probably about seven times. The two biggest laughs are when Buddy wanders into the women's section at the mall and spots a tight see-through red shoulder strap shirt and the sign next to it reads, For Someone Special, so Buddy sends it to his dad and the other big laugh is also in the mall where Buddy walks up to a lady holding a perfume bottle and Buddy tries it out, only he sprays it in his mouth. The slew of great actors and actresses are great in their roles, but there is not a lot to comment on about them except they get the job done. There is very little else to like here except for a few sporadic scenes, but they are placed to far apart for it to be worthwhile. New Line Cineama provides this film with their infinifilm special features which deserves special mention because the features are shorter and more entertaining than the entire movie together! The main highlight is the commentary provided by director Jon Favreau and actor Will Ferrell. They share nifty little tide-bits about making the film and they make it easier to sit through.The Bad News: The biggest problem is the pacing, the film is ninety-five minutes long and they could have shortened it to about an hour. I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell, but I do realize he has acting skills and to me he looked like he was bored and wanted to collect a paycheck as soon as possible. A lot of the characters should have been thrown out for their uselessness. Most scenes feel contrived as if they dug it out of a hole in the ground such as the mail scene. What in the world? Although there are laughs some jokes fall flat on their faces and are not funny at all. The script by David Berenbaum and the direction by Jon Favreau suffers a lot and feels choppy and hackneyed. Through most of the running time the film is a complete bore and it is pretty hard to sit through. The awful costumes for the elf's is just well what can you say except awful. It's hard to digest the colors together and to have to see one character run around in the same outfit for the entire running time which is hideous doesn't add to the film at all. One of the most important elements in a film like this is to believe in the make believe world, but here you don't believe at all and it doesn't help that the special effects are really bad and it can get distracting. The relationship between Buddy and Jovie is really tacky and comes almost as an after thought.Conclusion: Most of the jokes are good and there are enough good things to not declare it a total waste, but according to me... Not RecommendedRated: PG for some mild rude humor and language","

","Elf is a sweet little movie about Buddy who is raised by elves in Santa's workshop on the north pole, but Buddy isn't an elf, he's in fact a human and as such dosn't have the same nimble fingers as the other elves. When Buddy is told by his adoptive elf father that he's a human he goes to NY to find his birth father, here mayhem ensures because life here is very different than what Buddy is used to, furthermore Buddy has to save or rekindle the Christmas spirit.Plot wise this is an okay little story, however as a fantasy buff, I was a bit disappointed by the elves, whom have more in common with a Gnome or Halfling than Elves who normally are about the same height as humans. Jon Favreau does capture the normal dislike between Dwarfs and Elves but as mentioned the elves in this movie has nothing to do with the general look of elves. The effects are so-so, what little there are anyway. The acting is also so-so with Mare Winningham and Zooey Deschanel performing best but in no way spectacular.All in all a sweet little movie to waste a Christmas Holiday with but nothing more. 5 out of 10","

","Will Farrell seems to have taken a page from the Jim Carrey look-at-me school of acting. People like Carrey, and Farrell, and Bette Midler were probably the kind of people who, as small children, would jump onto the empty stage in malls and put on a show for their delighted parents, while other patrons walked by scratching their heads. It's not to say that these people aren't occasionally funny, but when your entire celebrity is built on self-referentialism, you'll hit more wrong notes than right ones. I have a hunch that they did many, many takes of each scene in this movie.Anyway, the funniest parts of this movie come from the veteran actors themselves: Steenburgen, Asner, Newhart, and Caan. Each of them has perfect straight-man timing to Farrell's manic funny-man Elf. Steenburgen's spaghetti breakfast, Asner's crabby Santa, Newhart's deadpan delivery and Caan's irritable reactions are all priceless moments. Farrell is basically himself, the same person he plays in every movie, and yet even given his two-dimensional portrayal of a man raised as an elf, his peculiarly funny mannerisms are somehow never tiresome. With a manic laugh or flick of his eyes he can be humorous, but he often seems bereft of an inner critic and tends to overdo it. For instance, the dinner scene is hilarious (""Is there sugar in maple syrup?""...""Yes""...""then YES!""), but Farrell ruins the lighthearted banter by belching for a full minute, a scene that should have been left on the cutting room floor.All in all, not a bad Christmas film, although the entire Central Park scene looks like it was written into the script at the last minute. It's all a bit overdone, but then they had to have some warm fuzzies or it wouldn't be a Christmas movie.","

","Christmas movies go into two categories. There are the ones that become classics and sometimes become a part of a family's Christmas tradition. Then there are the ones that are just there for the season, like the ones made for TV or just some that have been forgotten. This movie is definitely one that will become an instant success in your house around the holidays.Elf is the story of Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell) who is essentially the spirit of Christmas as we like to see it. Buddy is a human living in the North Pole because he found his way into Santa's sack of toys. Growing up around elves, he began to notice some differences between him and the other elves. When Buddy's adoptive father Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells Buddy that he isn't an elf, he sets out on a journey to New York City to find his father Walter (James Caan), the publisher of children's books who doesn't really know the meaning of Christmas.During his time in NYC, Buddy shacks up with Walter and his family. He gets a job working as a department store worker in their Christmas department. There he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), the girl who catches Buddy's eye with her kindness and great personality. Buddy tries to get his father off of Santa's naughty list and bring his family closer together.Ferrell is absolutely perfect as Buddy. His childish character is hilarious and what better than letting a ""kid"" run free in New York City. A place full of new experiences like traffic, rotating glass doors, and elevators. His character really does embody the spirit of Christmas. To be good, sing songs, and celebrate. Although Christmas has gone commercial, this movie is a great way to feel good around the holidays. The relationship between Buddy and his father is an awkward one at first, but grows over time. Whenever they are near each other it is a laugh riot. Ferrell is always hilarious and truly makes the movie. Nobody could have been Buddy better than Will.Elf is a joy to watch over and over again. Soon after you see it you will be quoting it all day long. It's addictive in a good way. Ferrell has been on a roll with movies as of late and this is a Will at his best. He makes being a big kid look easy and fun. Elf has comedy and is appropriate for the whole family. This movie will make you feel all warm inside even in the North Pole. Elf is a winner.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1105369/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1105369,7," If you're looking for just one good Christmas movie this holiday...
","When I first saw the trailer for Elf a little more than six months ago, I immediately jumped to the conclusion that it would be yet another Christmas movie rehash, with elves, Santa Clause, and snow to draw its audience. But to my surprise, when I first saw Elf, I was more quickly drawn back in awe than let down. It's totally different than what I was expecting. Yes, it has elves, Santa Clause, and snow in it. But it's not the same as everything else you may have seen this holiday season. Elf is it's own movie. Not confined to the age-old tradition like a lot of other films.First of all, the acting is simply top-notch and superb to the max. There can be no denying that. Will Ferrell is, without a doubt, on the top of his game in Elf. He displays all the signs of a good, up-and-coming actor. As if his comedian skills were not grand enough, now it looks like he is set on outdoing himself with acting. While some of his previous movies have done nothing but upset me, this one definitely made up for all of those. Then there is James Caan, who plays the role of Buddy's (Will Ferrell) father. As a grumpy, miserable old man, Caan churns out a good performance, and his change in attitude toward the end of Elf leaves the movie on a touching note. Not to forget the supporting cast, however. Bob Newhart (Papa Elf) and Zooey Deschanel (Buddy's ""interest"") both do their thing, especially Zooey who's character I really liked.Christmas movies tend to be quite like one another. But something in Elf sticks out and makes it a whole different movie. I'm not sure if it was Ferrell eating candy and syrup-covered spaghetti, the snowball fight that ensued in between, or the epic ending that featured Santa Clause escaping from the media, but Elf just clicked with me.As for complaints about Elf, I have but a couple that I'd have to say narrowly took away from the film. First and foremost is the predictability of it all. The ending is all too obvious; it wouldn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that everyone would leave happy, and Santa Clause would race off into the night sky shouting ""ho ho ho"". Nor was it too hard to guess that James Caan would come around sooner than later. Again, quite predictable. Also, the ending bugged me. I didn't like the angle of the media chasing Santa Clause. Up until the end, though, Elf was nearly flawless But these two flaws don't hurt the score of Elf too much.So if you're looking for one good holiday film this Christmas, look no further than Elf. I overlooked it from the beginning... heck, you probably will too. But give it a try. I promise you, it will definitely be worth your time!","

","""Elf"" directed by Jon Favreau turned out the other night on a cable channel. Not having see this popular film before, we decided to take a look. Frankly, it was a pleasant surprise. The film, written by David Barenbaum, takes great pleasure in bringing together the unreal world of Santa Claus and his helpers, the elves, with present day Manhattan. What a ride are we in for! As played by Will Ferrell with deadpan manner, Buddy, the elf of the story is wiser than some of the people he meets along the way. The encounter with a father, Walter, he didn't know until now, is at the center of the story. The jaded city people are not ready for this childlike figure that is all kindness. James Caan, an otherwise intense type, makes a great contribution to the film. Mr. Favreau gets good performances from his talented cast.""Elf"" will be appreciated not only by children, but those young at heart who will have a great time watching the film.","

","One of the funniest Christmas movies is Elf that stars Will Ferrell, James Caan, Bob Newhart, Edward Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Deschanel, and Michael Lerner! Wil Ferrell is is just excellent in this film. He hilarious and charming and I really like his character. Caan is also very good in the film and so is Steenburgen. Lerner has a very good performance too. The acting by everyone else in the film is good. There are so many hilarious moments in this picture and when I saw Elf it I just could not believe it! Its that funny! I love Ferrell's walk in the park. The music by John Debeney is excellent! If you want to see Wil Ferrell as a hilarious character and want to see a very good Christmas film then I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy Elf today!","

But was I ever pleasantly surprised! This movie was really funny! Wil (Buddy the elf)was hliarious as a man raised to believe he is an elf. His genuinely good heart and sweet disposition just make you smile, even when hes not saying a word. To see 'tough guy' James Caan in a comedy was also a bonus- he is great as a cold-hearted New York career man! As always, Bob Newhart is just awesome- who is more funny than him? His facial expressions alone deserve comedy awards!!! True this film is not gonna win any awards but who cares?! It has a great supporting cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly! Its is funny, enjoyable and a really good holiday picture. Great for kids, adults, teenagers, whoever!! You're gonna laugh and thats what a comedy is for!!!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875680/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875680,NA," It's what you'd expect really
","SPOILERS (but then, it was always going to be predictable!)So it's Christmas time again, and as per usual, in amongst the ""Lord Of The Rings"" and the other big blockbusters, there's the occasional Christmas fairytale. This year's offering is ""Elf"" staring Will Ferrell, a film which is really exactly what should be expected.In ""Elf"" Ferrell plays Buddy, a baby who one Christmas crawls into Santa's sleigh, and is then raised by Elves as their own. Thirty years later and Buddy finally realises that he's different to everyone else (despite being double their size of course). So with this in mind, Buddy heads off towards New York looking for his biological father (James Caan). Whilst there, Buddy influences everyone around him, and eventually revives the Christmas spirit.So what can actually be said about ""Elf""? Well, first and foremost, someone on here wrote that this film will be shown every Christmas for years to come. That person is spot on. ""Elf"" is forever going to be shown along with a selection of films (""Jingle All The Way"", etc) over Christmas at times when adults will want to sleep and children will want to be distracted. Secondly, it's worth stating that this film isn't as bad as some people might expect. If you expect cheese and you expect that weak plotted family film, your probably spot on. The special effects are simplistic when used, and the plot might be as weak as previously mentioned, but all in all, what would you expect from a film about an oversized elf?I guess it's hard to say too much about Farrell as I must admit to being a newcomer to his humour. He does what seems an acceptable job, and he cracks the occasional hilarious line. What seems ironic though is that some of the funniest lines are actually designed for adults and spoken by James Caan. Right now I can imagine people reading this review thinking ""what the hell is he on about?"", well all I can suggest is to listen more carefully. There is, I admit they're rare, the occasional really funny comment made in this film which, as a result of it being a childs film, probably won't be noticed in a cinema full of children. These comments aren't particularly hidden, but they are throw away comments which aren't fussed over.To summarise, ""Elf"" was never going to be anything special. It was always going to be a typical Christmas story, designed primarily for children, but with the occasional throw away adult line. With this definition in line, ""Elf"" fulfills it's pledge. It doesn't look though like the type of film which would really make too much money (In England anyway, it's run has coincided not only with the final ""Lord Of The Rings"" film, but also with the far more appealing live action version of ""Peter Pan""). This film is in the end of the day, definately one for television.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875678/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875678,7," Not a bad Christmas comedy at all, though nothing great
","Jon Favreu and Will Ferrel as a director/star combo is a good premise and execution here in Elf, as they create a film that assuredly works for the whole family.  This is because the film is as much directed towards fans of Ferrel from Saturday Night Live (which ranges with both sexes from little kids to people in their middle ages) as it is towards those looking for the holiday spirit.  Bottom line is, he makes the movie fun to watch, among a cast of well knowns (the likes of Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, Artie Lange, and Andy Richter pop up, and James Caan has a better than average supporting role).  Here, Ferrel plays Buddy, a man who's grown up adopted in the North Pole.  Raised by Elves, it pains him to find out that he isn't one, and that his father didn't even make Santa's 'Nice' list this year.  He decides to seek him out in New York, and has a brief stint working in a department store, followed by the mailroom of his father's office in the Empire state building.From what I described of the plot it sounds a little routine, and it is, but there are some things in the story that are inspired, though most of the joy in the film comes from Ferrel's Buddy.  Some might take his performance as over the top or lame, however I think he finds just the right bit of gleeful un-awareness at what he does, good and not so good, and there are a few real howlers too.  Best scene- Buddy confronts the department store Santa in front of the children (this is a near draw with the scene in the recent Bad Santa where Billy Bob beats down the plastic reindeer in the store).  Only the last part of the film, the Christmas Night bit, doesn't work at all.  A nice little Christmas comedy, which can be seen after the Holidays too. B+","

","As the delightful human who was raised by elves at the north pole, Will Ferrell, the greatest new comic actor out, walks a fine line between satire and genuineness.If he played Buddy completely for laughs, the movie would not imbue the audience with christmas spirit, and make us forget our doubts for a magical hour and a half.If he played Buddy completely subversively, poking fun at the christmas myth, adults would perhaps have had a few more laughs than they did.The reason Ferrell's performance is one of the best comic performances in recent memory, is that it serves both these purposes: there is a hint of satire in Ferrell's over-the-top enthusiasm, yet the innocence on his face appears absolutely genuine. One of the greatest sources of humour in the movie comes from actually believing Buddy has the mind of a child.Truly a remarkable thing. After this he goes on my list of greatest comic actors.My other favourite thing about this movie (which i found absolutely magical) was exciting newcomer Zooey Deschanel. She was absolutely radiant in this movie. I would watch it again just to watch her. She played William's sister in ""Almost Famous"" who leaves home to become an airline hostess (and plays Simon & Garfunkel's ""America"" to her mother to explain why she must, in one of the movies's best scenes). She also played one of the funniest characters in ""The Good Girl"" - Cheryl who remedies her boredom with her job by insulting customers without their understanding. I've now become a pilgrim of hers, and will follow movies wherever she goes. And believe me, i'm not usually this enthusastic!","

","Former ""Saturday Night Live"" standout Will Farrell stars as a man who was actually reared at the North Pole by Santa Claus (Ed Asner) and a group of kind and loving elves (led by Bob Newhart) after he wandered into Asner's bag of toys by accident one night at an orphanage when he was a baby. Fast-forward 30 years and the secret is finally out that Farrell is really human and that his father (James Caan) hails from New York City of all places. Now Farrell decides to leave the only home he has ever known in order to hopefully fit in with the human world, but his transition is difficult with usually hilarious results. ""Elf"" is another one of those productions this year that I liked even though there is really not as much substance as I would have hoped. Farrell, who was the only redeeming thing in the disgusting ""Old School"", is basically given free-will to run everything in the show and ends up dominating with a consistent performance that is surprisingly believable and definitely comical. Everyone else is present, but Farrell proves to be a true comedic force almost by himself. Overall the good messages sent by the film, the smart Christmas undertones and some very creative attempts at entertaining its audience are all enough to make ""Elf"" a strange winner that could best be described as the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. 4 stars out of 5.","

","Affable, amusing holiday fare.  There's really nothing terribly new here--the film's basically a collection of Christmas-movie clichés strung together like Buddy's meticulously crafted paper snowflakes.  But Will Ferrell's deeply committed performance makes things worth our while. Ferrell seems to be that rarest of creatures, the `Saturday Night Live' alum who actually can make it on the big screen.  Here he gives a big, childlike, wonderfully straight-faced performance--he never winks at the audience, and that's what gives him his charm.  In fact, the entire production has a refreshing earnestness about it--there's nothing all that special about Jon Favreau's direction (though his quick cuts in the reindeer scenes preserve the illusion beautifully), but we have to admire the fact that there are no annoying pop-cultural references, grossout gags, or smarmy jokes for the adults to laugh at.  There aren't too many belly laughs, either, but unless you have a heart of stone, you're likely to have a smile on your face for the entire 95 minutes.  7 out of 10.","

","I'm starting to think that there are dumb comedies and smart comedies. The ""dumb"" ones typically I cannot stand and usually fall into the banal (Farelly brothers) or ride one joke to exasperation (""Romy and Michelle's high School Reunion"")This is a pretty good dumb comedy. One that thankfully gets by on a single belch, a little ""tasteful"" vomit and a urine joke that spears asparagus. Instead it relies more on us liking and maybe even identifying with an ""idiot"" who is more childlike than clueless.The more Will, the more power it has...especially when we get detours from the required plot landmark visits. Scenes like... -   Will running around New York city waving at a guy hailing a taxi, swapping pamphlets, etc... -   Will hitting the ""maple"" in the mail room...making a best friend -   Will getting a DNA check at the doctor's (director Favreau)That last section may have been the funniest to me, as it felt the most free... I suspect some of that was just plain improvised based upon the props on the set??Overall of course 99% of this was scripted, but whenever a film can at least feel like the comic is just riffing, that is a key for me. (And I think it is where Eddie Murphy's career evaporated...)Certainly this film is well planned out, but to its credit (and largely to Ferrell) it does have a looseness. If you enjoyed Ferrell on SNL, you should likely be able to find humor in this. Or if you like tromp l'oiel this has some nice bits... Some of the other grandiose reviews on this (lauding Asner, for what exactly?) might unjustly inflate expectations. Product placement was a little heavy here, I wish they'd skipped that and just not spent the money on the CGI sleigh ride from the four horsemen/orcs of the central park rangers. The ending of the film suffers as many comedies do, it's the time when everyone has to pass their papers to the front.Favreau is a sharp and gracious fan of film (from his IFC show) and Ferrell is funny as a stand-up sort of everymoron. 7/10","

","Good Christmas movies are a rare find, great Christmas movies even more rare. At this point, I wouldn't yet count ""Elf"" among my very favorite Christmas movies, like ""A Christmas Story"", ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" or ""Ernest Saves Christmas"" (that's right, I said ""Ernest Saves Christmas""), but I really loved it, and I think that it may join those other movies once it ages a bit. It really is that good.Will Ferrell is definitely an acquired taste, but it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't be amused and delighted by his very enjoyable performance as Buddy, a human who was raised by elves in the North Pole after he crawled into Santa's toy bag as a baby.Thirty-or-so years later, when Buddy has outgrown his elf surroundings, Papa Elf (a droll Bob Newhart) suggests he go to New York City to find his real father (James Caan).Naturally, there are no big curveballs thrown at the audience. There are lots of fish-out-of-water jokes, an innocent romance with a co-worker (Zooey Deschanel, who is great and looks much better with blonde hair than I expected), and a heartwarming ending, as expected. But this isn't the kind of movie that needs to be extra-original, and it more than makes up for its lack of originality with huge amounts of heart and charm.Having a pro actor/filmmaker like Jon Favreau directing (and not just some hack) is also definitely a plus. He gives a formulaic Christmas movie style and feeling, filling the soundtrack with lots of big band jazz and assembling a great supporting cast that also includes Mary Steenburgen, Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Andy Richter and KG! (Tenacious D fans will know who I'm talking about)All in all, this is a very fun, very pure movie that I heartily recommend to anyone who, like me, thinks that most Christmas movies suck. This is the real deal, and I know that because it made me feel like a kid again.","

Sadly, this movie cannot offer a clear answer.I don't think it is possible for Ed Asner to be a warm cheerful believable Santa.  Tim Allen has the range to hit the warm fuzzy Santa notes.One other point, some people here seem confused about Buddy being a slow worker at the North pole, and a fast worker in New York.  The explanation for this is that Buddy is slow only if compared to real elves.  Compared to humans, Buddy's elf training makes him seem to have superior skills and abilities.","

","This is the family movie hit for the holidays! I was very excited to see this movie as I am a big fan of SNL and Will Farrell. He did a superb job in this movie and the supporting cast was excellent. I had already had such high hopes for this movie that I wasn't sure if it could get any better, but it did. The storyline is a classic ""make you feel good"" theme. I would recommend this movie to anyone and it is one that I will add to my personal collection when it comes out on DVD and it will be one of those movies like Christmas Vacation that I will watch several times around the holiday season every year. Take the whole family to this show. It's worth every penny. :)","

","View from the Second Star: Elf Elves, it seems, are good for one of three things. Building shoes while the shoemaker is asleep, making cookies and tea in trees, or manufacturing presents for all the good little girls and boys in Santa's workshop. ""Elf"", starring Will Ferrell, is the story of a human baby who snuck into Santa's toy bag while he was delivering toys to an orphanage. Santa, the kind hearted old fellow that he is, upon find this child in his toy sack, had this human baby raised in the North Pole amongst the elfish as one of their own. However, when a now fully grown Ferrel, learns of his mysterious history, he sets out for New York city to find his father and his past. Well actually not his past, just his father. sort of. This movie was funny - and anyone who says it was otherwise isn't me. From intro to the credits, I chuckled my way along the twisted bewildering path down which Ferrel leads the audience. The costume alone was a slap-in-the-face; it had me giggling at least once every fifteen minutes. Will Ferrell is hilarious: his expressions, his mannerisms, and this innocent little Elf routine: gold my friends, gold. He was good on Saturday night live, he's great in Elf. The story itself isn't really much more than a vehicle for Ferrell's parade of cutesy insane behavior. A workaholic father, a mom who cares, and a son who needs a friend, cliché if ever there was; yet somehow, a six foot elf-man really brings the whole thing together. No moment to cheesy, no ""Dad I love you"" ending. Its obvious that this film wasn't created to cater to the family audience; I think, moreover, this film was designed specifically not exclude the family while appealing Ferrels main fan base, the teens and twenty somethings, at the same time. We've seen comedy designs like this before; Shrek anybody? Another example would be Shrek.The only grievances I have for this film revolve around the late third and forth quarter where things begin to slow down comedy wise. The ""I'm an Elf in the city"" routine works beautifully, but one can only laugh at the same thing for so long. Aside from the wrap up being a little boxy, the lagging denouement, this film's marginal errors are hardly noticeable to the always entertained eye. A ridiculous setting, a heavily recycled story, and a man dressed in yellow tights. This movie has no point, but who cares - I sure didn't, and I usually care too! It works, and it's funny. Good for the kids, great for the dates. Not doing much Friday night, or any night for that matter? Why not go see Elf; if you don't have many friends you can always find people to sit with there. 7/10","

","Will Ferrell is a pure performer, everything he does, he goes head-first into. I didn't love him in Old School, though many many many other did love the over-the-top 37 year old college kid, but I did admire his enthusiasm for the role and his commitment to make it funny. His shtick works much better for me here in Elf, the story of a 6'4"" elf named Buddy in Santa's workshop, twice as big as his fellow workers, though not twice as productive. His size hurts his ability to work hard, eventually leading to Papa Elf (the always devastatingly understated Bob Newhart) to tell Buddy that his father is a real human from New York, and Buddy came to the North Pole by accident. After leaving the Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer-esquire North Pole for New York. The childish naiveté of Buddy in the corporate world of business New York at Christmas time gets him into trouble, first with a department store Santa (Artie Lange from the Howard Stern show) then with an children's author who is said to have sold more books than Dr. Seuss, the surly Miles Finch (Peter Dinklage). James Caan plays Buddy's real father, he has the difficult job of playing straight man to Will Ferrell while convincing us that he really does think his son worked for Santa Claus. Mary Steenbrugen is Caan's wife, a woman who takes to Buddy right away and does not question where he came from and how he knows her husband. And then there is Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), a department store clerk who falls for Buddy, even though he sounds like a 14 year old, but somehow that wins her over. There is a lot to Elf that can be dismissed as too out there, but it is the triumph of director Jon Favreau (Swingers) that we buy into Buddy's character, that we root for both he and Santa (Ed Asner) to save Christmas, and that we don't question what is going on with Jovie's fascination with Buddy. Farrell sells Buddy to the max, every time we see him, we see a man in yellow tights walking down the streets of New York (or Vancouver, either or), running out into traffic and hugging James Caan. What would Papa Corleone think? Finally, there are the cute little animals that live in the North Pole, Favreau brings us claymation character like the ones we see in ""Rudolph"" and countless other Christmas specials, and I'm a sucker for them. Especially walruses. This last touch, seen in the beginning of the film, takes the viewer back to their younger days, where every year we wonder if Santa will be able to leave the North Pole because of the thick fog, and every year, Rudolph comes to the rescue. I think that's where the film's charm comes from. While not a great film, Elf is harmless holiday fun for the entire family, well mostly harmless. Will Ferrell does wear yellow tights...","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1010113/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1010113,9," Elf provides gigantic laughs!
","""Elf"" is a movie about a big guy in a green suit that made some big green and made other filmmakers green with envy. Speaking of ""Made"", ""Elf"" was directed by Jon Favreau; the star & director of ""Made"" and star & writer of ""Swingers"". With the blockbuster status of ""Elf"", Favs is evolving into one of the superlative comedic directors of our generation. The star of ""Elf"" is not doing too shabby himself. And why not! He is probably the funniest entertainer working in show business. I am not ""toying"" with you! Of course, I am referring to Will Ferrell. His performance as Buddy, the lanky nitwit raised by elves who is now on a quest to find & bond with his biological father, was the paramount laugh riot work of 2003. It had me in stitches! (This way the elves could put me back together.) Another impressive showstopper was Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the toy store employee who becomes Buddy's fem buddy. Deschanel is an actress on the up-rise who is definitely not on the bad acting ""naughty list""; even though this hot blonde could be naughty to me anytime. ""Elf"" also contains the best comedy scene of 2003; the corporate meeting scene when Buddy mistakes a surly publication executive giant (wonderfully played by dwarf actor Peter Dinklage) for an elf is honest to say as absolute comedic mastery. ""Elf"" is ""boy toy"" heaven at its best; I hope that was not taken in a certain context. ***** Excellent","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0987640/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0987640,10," Thought I'd groan - but I guffawed instead!
","I have to say, the negative comments for this movie are out of line - way out of line. Especially since, based on the promos, I expected them to be right on the money. If I'd read those reviews before seeing the movie, I never would have gone to see it. Hold on - that's exactly what happened until now.Am I glad a local theater was having a free screening for kiddies and my six-year-old dragged me to see it. I have not seen a movie that provided so many belly laughs in years. I will now go buy the DVD.I am a newly converted Will Farrell fan, surprised to find myself saying so. Elf was jam-packed with subtle (sometimes even cerebral) humor I hadn't expected. I braced myself for the typical sophomoric toilet humor mixed with not-so-thinly-veiled sexual innuendo which seems to pass for comedy lately. Imagine my thrill to find the lowest comedy in this film to be an unimaginably long belch followed by a line that even drew a ""HA!"" from prissy me.OK, the reference to the short-statured man as an elf was pretty predictable, and in my opinion not terribly funny. But along with the eating of gross things, it apparently was there to toss a bone to those whose idea of humor might not have developed at the same rate as their physiques, and it certainly didn't cross the line the way some ""family films"" have.If you are a parent or family-oriented person who is looking for a wholesome good time with a fun Christmas message to get you in the spirit, this is a must-have for your video collection.If you are a would-be ""artiste"" or pseudo-intellectual who considers Spielberg a ""hack"", or if you prefer the frat-boy humor of lighting farts, and jokes about bodily functions, this is definitely not the show for you. You'll only relate to about 1/8 of the humor, and those parts are really intended for the younger audience. Also, you won't find sex, drugs or deep relationship twists. They managed to leave out angst and ""life sucks"" issues and don't even try to give any kind of ""film noir"" feel to a single scene. Nobody dies, and the only people who take themselves too seriously are the bad guys. There is a brief moment of ""violence"" in the toy store spat, but it really won't stack up to ""The Matrix"".So use your common sense. This is a feel-good Christmas comedy, rated G for the whole family. If you want something dark and gritty, or something with inane low-brow humor, watch something else. Why would you watch a G-rated Christmas movie and expect anything other than light-hearted, somewhat predictable fun with a happy ending? This film goes the extra mile with Farrell avoiding the trap of overacting, and balancing his right-on-without-quite-going-over-the-top character with the understated, inarguable talents of the rest of the cast. This is combined with special effects that are so well executed they go almost unnoticed (rather than slapping you in the face, they quietly contribute to the story, adding to the atmosphere rather than taking over the scenes).PS: I never thought I'd buy ""Lou Grant"" as Santa, but Ho-Ho-Ho-Boy was I wrong! -- OOPS. Too Punny; not funny. Trust me, the writers of Elf were much more skilled in their scripting!","

Bill Murray, Jane Curtain, Dan Ackroyd and Dana Carvey can carry a movie and keep the continuity. Most of the others can't. The jury was still out about Will Ferrell until I saw Elf. A nice little film that has landed on my ""watch every Christmas"" list. Great supporting turns from James Caan, Zooey Deschanel (Who sings beautifully), Mary Steenbegen, Bob Newhart and Ed Asner round out this delightfully written story about a boy who is raised as an elf. There's even a hip Burl Ives snowman played by Leon Redbone who sings a duet with Deschanel during the closing credits. Watch and enjoy.","

","This movie has its fans.  The ones who have already seen it several times and yell ""Yes"" at every inside, supposedly cool line in the movie.  They are more annoying than the movie itself, but not by much.  A comedy is supposed to make you laugh hard, not just smile occasionally.  I remember  several years ago, some geeks in my ""Dumb and Dumber"" audience not liking or getting that movie, an imperfect one admittedly, but one that had me laughing so hard at times that my stomach hurt. 'Will play every Christmas'?  I hope not.  Mainly for geeks and people without strong senses of humor, in my opinion.  I have been wrong with some comedies before, having seen some in a bad mood--as I did this one--and sold them short initially (""Meet the Parents"", for example, which I saw in a unpleasureable setting on rental, not in the theater, and did not initially like. While it is not as good as 1980's ""The In-Laws"", it is very good, which I discovered on repeat viewing).  Still, it seemed that every time I tried to get into ""Elf"", I was left unrewarded. As for the dorks sitting behind me yelling ""Yes"" and anticipating their favorite lines, it took everything I had not to jump over the seat and pummel them.","

However, this movie is hilarious and touching at the same time.I received this two years ago for Christmas and proceeded to watch it with my teenage siblings, my middle-age parents and my elder grandparents. All of us enjoyed the movie (even the teenagers, who are very fickle, let me tell you). How great is a movie that can bring together the whole family, on their own free will? Will Ferrel is a comic genius. I love his mannerisms and his style of comedy. I was skeptical about this movie at first, because I wasn't sure how anyone could pull off a Christmas movie and make it sensational. BUT THEY DID! I have even enjoyed this with my fellow peers in college (we made a drinking game to itevery time you see a Christmas tree...drink!....yea, i know, we're college students, so sue us).I just wanted to convey that this movie is enjoyable by any age. I own it, I watch it every year and I never get sick of Ferrel's zany comic routines.WATCH IT!","

","This movie is stupid!!! silly!!! predictable!!! and downright awesome!!! What more could you ask for in a movie. For young and old, this has the idiotic humor and the adolescent exepectations that are needed in today's comedies. This is a movie i can watch with my wife and child alike and not worry about having the explain anything to either of them. Great flick!!! Will is the man.... haven't seen a movie with him YET that i haven't liked .... Keep it movin .... you will enjoy this ...!!! Will has a way about him that fits any role that he partakes in and to date, i haven't seen him play a role that isn't incredibly stupid and ridiculous, but some people fit in that slot. Whether directors make movies with characters that will fit his outrageous personality or he just changes the game to fit the role needed, he keeps them coming back. As predictable as Will is, there is always a surprise in store for everyone!!!!","

","This is a nice movie to watch during the Christmas season, perfect for the whole family. Here, a man named Buddy raised as an elf at the North Pole is sent to the U.S. in search of his true identity, after growing to an unusual large size for an elf. He finds his biological father, played by James Caan, but must convince him that he is his son. When he interferes with his job, the father must decide: son or job. Thrown into the mix is Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel, whom Buddy falls in love with. The story is fun, with a catchy music score and funny characters. I especially like the snowball-fighting scene and the people's reaction when they discovered that there is really a Santa, who was flying away on his sleigh. I also like the fact how they depicted the North Pole as a real place, providing imaginary scenery and ambiance. This movie brings out the true Christmas spirit in everybody, though fictional in reality, everybody should have something to believe in. This movie could of used more comedy, though. But overall, a good family get-together movie. Grade B+","

","Okay,at first,this movie looked stupid. I thought it was a desperate attempt to make a good Christmas movie.Boy was I wrong. Elf is about a human named Buddy who was raised by elves after Buddy as a baby,crawled into Santa's sack while he was delivering presents to the adoption center.As Buddy grew up,he grew faster than the other elves but still grew up learning about having Christmas Spirit like the other elves.Then,still not knowing he was human,he overheard some elves discussing he was human and asked his adoptive father about his origin which lead Buddy on an adventure to the low-spirited city of New York to find his real father and possibly spread some Christmas Cheer.That's all I'm sharing with viewers who haven't seen this movie.Elf was probably the best Christmas classic movie I've seen since well,any other Christmas movie.This movie had hilarious moments and some moments where you just wanted to take a moment and wish you met an elf or anyone like Buddy.Will Ferrell really shines in this movie and proves to be an excellent actor as the innocent,child-like and lovable elf new to a city with no Christmas Spirit.He along with the other cast members bring this movie to life.Zooey Deschanel was amazing as Jovie,the moody yet considerate department worker who later discovers her amazing singing voice thanks to Buddy.James Caan was great as Walter,the grumpy and busy father of Buddy.I don't care what anyone else says,I loved this movie and really makes me laugh.I don't know about all or you but I'm rating this a 9/10","

","I had herd some good reviews, but I never liked Will Ferrell. After passing it by in the store like 9 times I decided to rent Elf. It was actually a lot better than I expected. It had a pretty well strung together plot and a lot of humor in-between. As a baby Buddy (Will Ferrell) crawls into Santa's bag at the orphanage and the elves decided to keep him. But one day buddy notices that he's six feet tall. His elf father(Bob Newhart) tells him were to find his real father (James Caan) , in New Your City. So Buddy goes in surch of his father. It kept me laughing up until about 20 minuets from the end. By that time I guess they had to tie it all up some how, it is still worth seeing. 8/10 Some mild language and crude humor that parents may want to look into before getting for young children.","

","I've seen a lot about Elf, but I hadn't ever seen it before. I actually was expecting something slightly different from Elf. I haven't seen Will Ferrell, so I had some weird expectations. For some reason I thought Elf would be intended for adult audiences. Now, well, it's not simply for kids, but it is a film for the whole family, which means it has a lot of themes kids appreciate more than adults. By that I mean such typical holiday spirit that grows towards the end - and how adults in the film aren't interested in Xmas or their children and blah blah. Sure, that is unfortunately true, but it has been used so many times in films it's becoming boring.Sure, Elf had some originality. The idea of an elf adjusting to human life is silly but interesting. Of course the theme of that idea has been explored over and over again, but adding the Xmas feeling to it makes it different from the typical theme. The story goes on the same way every single comedy film seems to go. It is funny until the end where it's almost sad because something goes so badly wrong, but in the end everything is alright again! I saw that pattern even before I was half-way through the film. But then again, it's a Xmas comedy film for the whole family. How could that be original? So when thinking of that, Elf was an alright film.","

Generally I like Will Ferrell but he is in his element as the oversized 'Elf' buddy, who finally realizes he doesn't fit in at the North Pole and goes off to find his real family. He brings his innocent, fun loving side to cynical New York and a workaholic father with very funny results. We love it for the laughs, but like all the best comedies, there is a serious message too. That everyone would do well to have a little bit of Elf in them, slow down, have fun, spend more time with your kids and worry less. OK that sounds cheesy but this film isn't cheesy really, it delivers the laughs and the family message in a very funny and enjoyable way. If you haven't got this on your family Xmas movie list, add it now!!","

I really enjoy some of his work (especially ""Anchorman"") while other things he does are just too silly and juvenile. This falls somewhere in the middle.Hipsters are happy to see Zooey Deschanel in this movie. I am more concerned with why she and Will Ferrell are matched up. If it is not strange enough that she would fall for a seemingly psychotic homeless man, there is a thirteen year age difference. That is just slightly creepy (though not really unheard of).After multiple viewings, I can see how the film is charming in its own way and there are even some subtle nods to Ray Harryhausen and Peter Billingsley. Any film that pays homage to these two has to be worth something.","

","Elf isn't a perfect Christmas movie, but it was sweet and charming with a great cast. The script can be a little too fluffy and unfocused sometimes though, while the pace occasionally lags and some jokes such as Buddy eating the sweets felt forced. However, it does look terrific, with the locations striking and the cinematography very nice. The soundtrack is a nice addition too, it made me nostalgic and all the more ready for Christmas. The story while simple and a tad predictable is at least original and well-meaning, while the direction is credible. The cast is what gives Elf its staying power and charm. Although I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, I think he really shone here as Buddy, while Zooey Deschannel is beautiful and a huge part of the film's charm, James Caan is a suitably gruff father-like figure and Bob Newhart is wonderful. All in all, it is a sweet film if you forgive the slightly cliché ending, by all means not for all but the cast do save the day. 7/10 Bethany Cox","

","Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) tells a story about a thirty year old man named Buddy (Will Ferrell), who lived in the North Pole. Buddy is the only human begin living in that area, since Buddy as a baby accidentally crawls on Santa Claus' (Ed Asner) sack. Buddy is raised by Papa Elf, when Buddy finally realized that he is human. Buddy decides to find his real father, who lives in New York City. His father Walter Hobbs (James Caan) is a humorless working business man, who has an family of his own. Since Walter has an wife named Emily (Oscar-Winner:Mary Steenburgen) and their son Michael (Daniel Tray). Buddy finds New York City to be an whole different place, since some of the people, he meets are cold-blooded. Buddy decides to bring Christmas cheer to the New Yorkers, especially his father and make them believe that Santa Claus truly exists. At the same time, Buddy falls in love with a shy department store worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel), who has an lovely voice. This is one adventure in the Big Apple that Buddy will never forget.Directed by Jon Farveau (Iron Man 1 & 2, Made, Zathura) made an amusing Christmas movie that is somewhat different and fresh, thanks to a very likable performance by Farrell. Which Farrell is absolutely charming and child-like in his role. Deschanel is lovely in her role as Buddy's love interest. This movie has some very funny vignettes and an strong cast in the supporting roles. Caan does his best in a underwritten role. Asner and Newhart has some moments in their scene-stealing roles. Peter Dinklage has one of the funnier moments with Farrell is the biggest laugh of the movie.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (Also in Pan and Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Single Disc DVD, the only special feature is the original theatrical trailer. ""Elf"" is certainly one of those movies will play during the Christmas holidays. ""Elf"" isn't a perfect picture, it has some flaws. But it is Farrell's amusing performance gives the heart in the right place, which it will delights kids and adults. ""Elf"" is a very good movie to watch, especially during Christmas. The movie has some choice cameos, including Peter Billingsley (Who is best known playing Ralphie in ""A Christmas Story) and director:Favreau as a doctor. (****/*****).","

","Will Ferrell is one of my favourite movie funny-men, but even so, I had my reservations about Elf: it is a Christmas film after all, and they do have tendency to get rather sappy for my liking.Still, I put aside my doubts, and to start with, I admit I had a chuckle-some time, with Will providing some amusing 'fish-out-of-water' moments as wide-eyed innocent Buddy, the titular 'elf' (in reality, a human adopted when a baby by one of Santa's workers) who leaves North Pole to travel to New York, where he hopes to find his real father (played by James Caan).Unfortunately, the makers of this film just can't help themselves, and gradually allow over-sentimentality to take control, before unloading a whole sackful of saccharine sweet clichés in the final act: Buddy's mean, inconsiderate father miraculously transforms into a loving dad; good old Santa pops up needing some Christmas spirit to power his sleigh; and everyone starts singing carols and being all happy and stuff! Hell, Buddy even gets the girl (pretty shop assistant Jovie, played by Zooey Deschanel). Gag! A bit of cheesy schmaltz is to be expected this time of year, but this amount in one massive dose is just too much for me to handle.I rate Elf an unexceptional 5.5 out of 10, very generously bumped up to 6 because, hey, it's Christmas!!!.","

","A delightful Christmas fantasy for all the family, proof that latter-day Hollywood can still knock out a charming festive film, just like in the old days.Sharing with the classic ""Miracle on 34th Street"" its New York department store setting, the story here is as improbable as any you'll encounter on any Feast of Stephen you care to mention. But forget that and just enjoy Will Ferrell accomplishing a wide-eyed but never over-played naiveté rarely seen since Jimmy Stewart in ""Harvey"" as the innocent elf (actually a human baby born out of wedlock) abroad, attempting to bond with his curmudgeonly old dad this particular Christmas (of course!).Thus Buddy's many humorous adventures and encounters with the people, sights and sounds of New York naturally take us on an emotional roller-coaster ride but by the end of the movie, as if you didn't know, he's gotten a pretty co-worker (the wonderfully named Zooey Deschanel) to fall in love with him, made up big-time with his dad and just for good measure restored Christmas spirit to all and sundry in a nice, even exciting conclusion, which gives us the memorable sight of Santa's sleigh taking off over Central Park so that old Saint Nick can get on with his naughty or nice list.The casting is very good, James Caan, like fellow 70's tough guy De Niro before him, adapting neatly to family comedy, with in support, the ever-lovely Mary Steenburgen as his too-good-for-him wife and old MTM stalwarts Bob Newhart and Ed Asner, even more improbably as Buddy's adopted elf-father and Santa Claus respectively. Ferrell makes the film though, his wide-eyed wonder infectious right from the outset. The only real drawback for me really was the too-obvious product placement inserts. Otherwise, the film stays away from maudlin sentimentality particularly in its treatment of children and is filled with uplifting Christmas music, settings and spirit, rarely stooping to vulgarity for its laughs (okay, we do get a couple of near-obligatory flatulence and burping jokes, but that's okay, kids love 'em!).I heartily recommend anyone in need of a Christmas tonic to watch ""Elf"" and bring out your inner-child.","

","Will Ferrel stars in the film Elf. Which isn't his best film but is a lot of fun. Ferrell is actually quite convincing as a human who crawled into Santa's bag during a toy delivery when he was a baby. Buddy(Will Ferrell) has been living in the North Pole for many years and every one of the elves starts to suspect something. Buddy soon realizes that he is a human, and begins the search for his father. His father is living in New York, with a new family. When Buddy sees his father(James Caan) for the first time, he boots him out of the house. Or out of the Empire state building. So Buddy tries to get acceptance from his father and his family and succeeds with his everyone else but his father. Buddy wreaks havoc and falls in love with a department store Elf(the great Zooey Deschanel). Elf is a fun Christmas movie. I don't think it is as good as Ron Howard's Grinch movie or bob Clark's A Christmas story, but the film works. Will Ferrell is pretty convincing and the film will get you in the Christmas spirit. The performances are good and it's a cute film. Jon Faverau somehow always tries to bring silliness of some sort into his movies. He does a good job here. I give Elf a big thumbs up. Elf: ***/****","

","""Elf"" was yet another Will Ferrel film that I thought from previews was just going to be silly and stupid.I've learned by now to get over my prejudices going into ""Silly and Stupid"" Will Ferrel films. They almost all are that. But somehow they are also funny, and tell stories with more depth than I would ever have imagined. By the way, the same phenomena happens with me regarding Adam Sandler movies. I always think they sound horrible, and I always have far more than my average share of laughs for a comedy.In elf, its unimaginable that an actor of Ferrel's age can bring off the complete naivety required for a human raised at the North Pole who enters American society as an adult. Yet he brings it off the same way be brings off all of his unlikely sounding roles.Of course, in the process the people he interacts with learn that a little naivety and purity of heart can be a good thing. Yes, there is both slapstick and (mild) gross out comedy, but overall this is a quite entertaining movie, and a suitable Christmas comedy for kids and parent to watch together.","

","One of the best of the more recently-made Christmas movies, ""Elf,"" for the most part, impressed me as a throwback to wholesome, quality holiday movies of the past. I say ""most part"" because the last fifth of the film suddenly switches gears and turns from being about Elf and his relationship with his dad into the sappy and clichéd ""do you believe in Santa Claus"" routine reminiscent of ""the Polar Express."" Up until that point, though, the film is consistently funny and enjoyable with Will Ferrel playing the title character to innocent and charming perfection. There are lots of funny scenes and bits, following each other one after another. Most of the cast is excellent, especially with James Caan's straightforward, deadpan portrayal as Elf's dad. (The lone exception is Santa played by Ed Asner, who comes off as a grumpy, unappealing curmudgeon.)But-drat! If not for that ending, this is the kind of movie I otherwise would love to have as part of my Christmas DVD collection.","

","Watch ""Elf"" a few times and it instantly becomes a favorite Christmas movie. At least it did for me. Nearly everything about this film is funny. An Elf (Will Ferrel) leaving the North Pole to find his real father (James Caan) is just the setup for this film. From there to the end it's straight laughs. So many great gags are formed by Ferrel's ignorance to the real world and other peoples' reactions to him. It's fast-paced and very funny. Some minor drawbacks include some gross sequences with Buddy the Elf overindulging in sweets in unappetizing ways, as well as an unnecessary scene in which he gets into a fight with a midget-sized famous author with a temper. Aside from that, it's one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in quite some time. I've seen it at least four times, and it's still just as funny. Not only is Will Ferrel well-cast for his role, but it's also great to see older stars such as James Caan and Bob Newhart make a comeback for this back. Watch it next Christmas or you'll miss out on an annual treat that is very charming and fun. Great for the whole family, and for just about anyone.***1/2 out of ****","

Its a difficult job for any adult actor to convey such innocent charm. The supporting characters are good, the directing very good, and the writing is excellent. I loved the run home to hide in his bathroom in his undersized house when he had his feelings hurt. The film was weaker in its second half, but Will Ferrell makes Elf such an endearing character that I've watched it repeatedly for just that.I really don't care for Will Ferrell's other movies or characters, but this was a wonderful performance!","

","Buddy the Elf(Will FArrell,still not yet a star at this point)has never truly been an elf. But raised from infancy in the North POle and knowing nothing other than the Elf lifestyle,he is as true a helper to old St.Nick as any of the other workers that are. At full adulthood and finally starting to realize that he's not like the others back home,he sets out for New York City to find his true family,mostly his father(JAmes Caan),now a Department store exec. I suspect that one need only see the trailers to figure that when Buddy finds his true father,a host of blissfully nutty events ensues.No surprises in this film,from the hi-jinx promised to the obligatory romance for BUddy,personned in this case by a bored but decent department store worker(Zooey Deschenal,neither too sweet nor too sour). The casting is so letter perfect it seems almost brainless:Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father,Ed Asner as Santa Claus,MAry Steenburgen as Caan's understanding wife,Andy Richter and Kyle Gass as Caan's underlings,Amy Sedaris as Caan's sweet secretary and Peter Dinklage as a very un-elf-life storybook author who looks like he could be a perfect ringer for one of Kris Kringle's workers. Director Jon FAvreau's movie moves as easily as any,and while I personally wouldn't call this a ""new classic""(though it would still seem like MIracle on 34th Street compared with another holiday themed film that came out around that time,Bad Santa)in Yule flicks,this makes for perfectly fine holiday themed entertainment.","

","I've thought a lot about this movie before writing this review. At first, I didn't think much of Elf, based on what I'd read about it and my not being a huge fan of either Will Ferrel or Jon Favreau. However, I kept hearing my friends who had seen it rave about it; friends whose taste I respected. So, I caught it one day on USA. I'm a big fan of holiday movies. I'm a sucker like that. I really like the 1934 version of A Christmas Carol, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas (animated version,) White Christmas, The Charlie Brown Christmas Special, all the real classics. After multiple viewings of Elf, I have to say that based on at least three reasons it is a bona-fide holiday classic, whose destiny is to sit on the same shelf as all the heavyweights.1. The brilliant casting (James Caan is incredible and Bob Newhart as narrator was a stroke of genius.) 2. The absolutely superb acting, including a career-making performance by Will Ferrel (can you imagine anyone else in that role? Okay, Martin Short aside,) 3. The fantastic direction by John Favreau (look no further than the scene with the jack-in-the-box, it was poignant and hilarious, always an incredibly tough combination.)The soundtrack is also incredible and chosen with a extreme care. Look, I could go on and on about this movie, but suffice it to say, it's a movie everyone should own, and pass along to their family.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1979438/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw1979438,7," Sometimes unsurprisingly cheesy, but an overall impressive Christmas comedy
","I have now seen a bunch of movies starring former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell, but it took me a while to get around to seeing this one, even though I have now been aware of its existence for probably about three years. It's getting to be that time of year again, and just yesterday, I finally rented ""Elf"", not exactly sure how impressed I would be. It could have easily turned out to be yet another cheesy, boring family movie from recent years, but while it may seem like that at times, it usually isn't. It's sometimes cheesy, and certainly not consistently hilarious, but I'm still impressed.One Christmas Eve, a baby boy at an orphanage is placed in his crib shortly before Santa comes. When Santa is not looking, the baby crawls into his sack and stows away to the North Pole, which is where he's finally discovered in that sack! The elves name him Buddy, after the label on his diaper, and Papa Elf volunteers to raise him. So, Buddy grows up at the North Pole, living the life of an elf, and still thinking he's one of them, even though he's a lot bigger than the others, and can't make toys nearly as fast as them. After finally finding out that he's actually a human, he learns about his real father, Walter Hobbs, who is a children's book publishing executive in New York, and doesn't even know Buddy was born! Buddy learns from Santa that Walter is on his naughty list, due to his selfishness, and the human raised by elves sets out to New York to find his father and change him. Obviously, this won't be easy, and it doesn't help that Buddy has never experienced the human world that awaits.The film starts out with an opening narration from Papa Elf, which certainly isn't the best part, and the segment where he says how trolls once worked for Santa, but they weren't toilet trained, showing an example with a troll in a diaper, may suggest the film is going to be another cheap gross-out comedy for kids. But hey, not so fast! The vast majority of the film is definitely NOT like that! I got some BIG laughs out of this movie, I think starting with some of the gags that involve Buddy's life as a grown human at the North Pole. I definitely laughed pretty hard when the main character meets a raccoon on his way to New York and tries to be affectionate with it! After he arrives in the city, the things he does there, being unfamiliar with life in a community like this, a lot different from the North Pole, are also good for laughs. Some of the gags I didn't care much for, including Buddy spinning around in a revolving door until he throws up in a garbage can, but for the most part, Will Ferrell's antics in the lead role didn't fail to amuse me. Interesting story as well.Being about Santa and his elves at the North Pole, one might think ""Elf"" is strictly for kids, and I guess I thought that might be the case. However, overall, I would say it has enough to please both child and adult viewers, not ALL of them of course (it's obviously not for the many Will Ferrell haters out there), but a lot of them. Now, there are obvious reasons why this movie is rated PG, a great example being Jovie (an employee at Gimbels, a clothing store in New York) singing in the shower, and Buddy coming into the restroom to sing along, not realizing she's naked! I found this to be another comedic highlight in the film, but parents might want to be cautious. Anyway, while this movie clearly isn't perfectly clean family fun, I would say it's close enough to it, and a lot better than the last Christmas movie I watched, ""Deck the Halls"", that's for sure","

","When i first thought about seeing this film, I was expected it to be some cheesy Christmas movie where Will Ferrell acts like an idiot but i was pretty wrong. Will Ferrell's character is a 30 year elf and he acts as if he hasn't seen humans..Although some of his acting is a little over the top he plays his character well. But other than that, the movie is a really nice Christmas movie. Its a classic Christmas story.In the beginning it starts out a little boring but then it picks up the pace and the movie gets more interesting. It starts better when Buddy (Will Ferrell) goes and moves out of his elf home and decides to find he's real dad in New York...This movie isn't really funny but it has some funny scenes. For example when Buddy goes to the mall and see's Santa Clause for the first time but he notices that its an impostor, then they start fighting...Another funny scene is when Buddy hangs out with his brother Michael after school then they see bullies throwing snow balls at them, so Buddy starts making a ton of snow balls then they start firing back at them and the bullies leave and run away. That was classic The movie is a really nice film but it has its mistakes, anyway great work","

","Will Ferrell seems like he will dive off the deep end of a 3 foot pool just to get a laugh. And, this was no exception. And I have to admit, I was laughing almost the entire time.Will just can't make a typical family movie. He injects not only humor, but humor that makes you cry when you watch. Acting like a complete kid, he plays the part of a regular human that grew up as an elf.Not knowing how to act in a human environment, he resorts to the strangest behavior. From sending his father women's clothing, to taking his date to a turnstile and running around a turnstile.Will Ferrell won me over. Much like his work ""Kicking and Screaming"", he takes what could have been a bomb and does something funny with it. I am impressed. ""A""","

","This movie is a favorite of mine. Will Farrell as Buddy is so hilariously oblivious about how an adult is supposed to behave. His child-like performance truly brings out the kid in all of us. Watching him stumble as he tries to ask Jovie out made me reminisce back to my own teenage years of awkward crushes. And you can't watch this movie and not laugh. I nearly wet myself when Buddy exposed the mall Santa as a fraud. (I've wanted to do that myself, but I don't have enough guts.. Besides, think of the children.) I will admit that parts of Elf are schmaltzy, but I love it anyway. The scenes with the little girl Buddy met at the doctor's office are really sweet. And I like the happily-ever-after ending.","

","Seems like most reviewers are anti-Will Ferrell. I don't watch SNL because it is always stupid, so I had no pre-conceived notions when I saw this movie for the first time on the big screen.I laughed when Ferrell was funny (which he was in this movie regardless of whether he is generally funny in anything else), I felt bad when he felt bad, and I was impressed that he was like an excited child about life. That's what made the movie worth watching. His character was always positive and wanting to make other people's lives better. He was so excited to meet his real father!! When he decorated the store, he was so excited!! Kids can really relate to him. How can anyone say the enthusiasm of his character was not funny or engaging? His character really was charming, so don't listen to the reviewers who just came on here just to trash Will Ferrell. Sometimes he would be sad because he would not ""fit in"" and these scenes were very touching. Some of us out there can relate to feeling like they somehow don't ""fit in"" with the rest of the world.It's true that the ending of the movie was very sappy and silly, but I could forgive this about it because the rest was so charming. This is a movie for the whole family, which is refreshing in this day and age. Anymore, Christmas movies seem to appeal to American audiences only when they are crude, revolting and degrading (i.e. - ""Bad Santa""). This movie was, happily, nothing of the sort. I have never understood why people think that being crude and gross somehow is funny. True humor is thoughtful and uplifts a person's heart, not degrades it.One of the most delightful surprises is that Ed Asner actually is GREAT as Santa Claus. Had I known he was this character before I saw the movie, I would have thought he was hugely miscast. But, he is a totally charming and warm Santa Claus.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good, clean holiday movie that has a thoughtful script and story.","

","""Elf"" is a sweet, little holiday movie that tells the fish out of water story of Buddy the Elf, played by ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Will Ferrell. Buddy leaves the North Pole, and winds up in New York City, the oft chosen location for these types of stories. Following the tradition of Charles Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", goodness and cheer is pitted against anger and greed, as Buddy attempts to remind people of the Christmas spirit. Ferrell plays the awkward elf in a highly sympathetic fashion, providing laughs as well as an emotional connection for the audience. The plot line fulfills the sappiness expectation of holiday films, but the light, heartwarming humor of the film is really its strongest attribute. It lacks the timeless quality of ""A Christmas Story"", but it keeps from delving into the dark humor of ""Scrooged!"". ""Elf"" is a good natured film worth at least one viewing.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0970150/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0970150,7," Weak third act dwarfs otherwise great film
","MINOR SPOILERSAlthough calling this film ""instant holiday classic"" is somewhat premature, that is not to say that ""Elf"" doesn't have its great moments. The only thing that keeps it from being entirely wonderful is its schmaltzy third act, which seems to give up after so much energy that the film had before and give it a Hollywood ending instead.Elf is a fresh take on an old premise of someone/thing leaves the North Pole because they feel out of place, and many viewers will probably be reminded of Dudley Moore's performance as Patch in ""Santa Claus: The Movie"" (1985). Only in this one, Ferrell's ""Buddy"" is really not an elf and so he is out of place at ""home"" but has grown up under elves and so seems out of place in the ""real world"" as well. Simple, yet effective.Will Ferrell brings a lot of the magic to this film as ""Buddy"" since he can so easily portray childhood glee and make it seem natural and make you smile at it - others have tried and been less successful. James Caan is also good as his crotchety father on the ""naughty list"" - he's got a good soul deep down but he's selfish and greedy, as you would expect a foil in Christmas movies to have. All is well and seems plausible even with Caan's character taking in Buddy since he IS his son despite him thinking he is crazy and annoying. There are some great scenes - one I really enjoyed was the mail room scene in which Buddy and a worker who looks like he escaped prison drink coffee with ""maple syrup"" and revert to drunken glee, a classic moment that made me smile. I only wish this type of scene was apparent towards the end. So what makes the third act weak? It is schmaltzy as I have said: Caan's character, who kicks out Buddy in a harsh way, suddenly has a change of heart because his other son comes in and calls him selfish before his nasty boss on Christmas Eve. This didn't work since it didn't seem like Caan cared about Buddy and REALLY wanted/needed this job and yet he up and quits. THEN to add to the cheese, there are scenes where Buddy's love interest sings and gets people of New York to sing thereby adding belief in Christmas again, thus saving Santa and therefore Christmas and therefore the world. The whole thing of Caan publishing a story from the whole thing and succeeding ties it up nicely though (and reminds me of Misery, in which he played an author -wierd), but that half hour before that needs to change since the pacing and events drag here and seem routine and cliché, which was disappointing.Also I have to add I enjoyed the claymation characters and Bob Newhart since he seemed like the perfect adopted father. I recommend that the studios remake this film in a few years but change the cheesy last third (but keep the first two) and they will then have a classic.OVERALL RATING: 7 of 10 stars. Worth a watch or two for fans of Christmas, family comedy and/or Will Ferrell, but be forewarned of a cheesy ending.","

I guess this movie is alright for fans of his, but from ""Elf"" to ""Old School"" to ""Roxbury"" to SNL, it seems to me that Ferrel's comedic talent is viewed as WAY more original and hysterical than it really is. I've just never seen the guy do anything that hasn't been done somewhere before, and better. As far as the film, I think it's a stretch to say that it's a ""star-studded cast."" I mean, James Caan is awesome, but can you name anything he's done in the last ten years? Bob Newhart? I'm sure his phone is just ringing off the hook. It's just sad that this is what SNL comedians do after their run on the show is over. Look at the SNL stars of the past that went on to bigger and better things. Dan Akroyd, Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, etc. Just seems that all the SNL stars of the past ten years just end up doing crap like ""Elf"" or ""The Ladies Man"" every other year, and a few cartoon voices on the side. Sorry, I just don't think Ferrel is ever going to be a bigger star than he is now.","

He gives so much depth into his character as Buddy's father. You can see his conflict of interest between his job and his son.Zooey Deschanel was the perfect choice. She isn't one of the plastic ""beauties"" that reign in Hollywood these days, and that lends itself very well to the classic-ness of the film.The whole thing is masterful.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0964841/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0964841,5," You sit on a throne of lies!
","This review took me some time to write, rewrite, and confirm my thoughts. Over the course of two days, I had to think about this film to make sure that I was putting my correct words down on paper. This film was reminiscent of an airplane take-off. As the plane begins for take-off it taxis around the runway (opening credits) and then gets its engines up to full throttle before eventually lifting into the air (the beginning of the film), but once in the air, we coast and outside of some brief turbulence, you have a smooth flight the rest of the trip. That is how I felt about the film Elf. Director Favreau (of Swingers fame) bursts onto this film with such raw imagination and humor that by the time he gets to New York City, he is panting for air and eventually tired of the entire endeavor. With a medium to medium rare Ferrell, Favreau starts this story with amazing imagery, some moments of classic Christmas television memories, and powerful creativity, but in the end it all reads like a Hollywood playbook. Everyone is in their positions, let's play a good game.Ferrell is a very funny actor. In fact, I praise him for the return of the 'funny' comedy with his work in Anchorman, but in this film it just feels as if he is going through the motions without the emotion. You could tell that he just didn't feel as comfortable in his role of Buddy as he did as Ron Burgundy. Farrell, and perhaps it was more the writers fault, provided no really memorable lines that the kids will be quoting for years to come nor did he do anything that wasn't already expected of him. I don't think this was his sled, for lack of a better word. Then again, perhaps it didn't work for me because he didn't have the backup he needed. Ferrell is one of those comic geniuses that play off other actors very well and some of the most memorable Ferrell moments are when he is ad-libbing with others. James Caan was a horrible choice as the father. He is cranky, yes, but not from acting. I couldn't help but cringe when I saw him at the end of this film, he was pathetic. I couldn't tell if he was interested in this film, or just needed some extra cash. I felt the same about the rest of the cast that surrounded Ferrell. Deschanel and Steenburgen were completely miscast and literally just walked through the motions spewing lines from their mouths to pay for their new car. The best example is when Zooey says to Ferrell, 'You missed' during the romantic scene. It was worse than poor and amateurish. Wasted talent from Sedaris and Richter only angered me further. The only saving actor from this entire film was Dinklage. He was hysterical and commanded the screen for the few minutes he was on literally stealing the scene from Ferrell. It was a plus in an already full film of minuses.For this film to really be pinnacle Christmas achievement, it needed some powerful writing that would just have you in your seat laughing because of the words behind Ferrell. Sadly, that could not be found in this film. There wasn't enough originality in the script to make this film really stand out. I saw a glimmer of it when the film began with some of the CGI animals, but that was lost indefinitely after the first ten minutes. When I first started watching this film, I saw it as a combination of all of our favorite Christmas programs. This perception ended when Buddy made it to New York. Riding in a cliché drawn horse and sleigh, we follow Buddy through New York as he attempts to bring humor to the simplest of situations. It felt as if when Favreau found a joke, he never let it go, nearly killing the fun each time. The syrup joke is the first that comes to mind. The second was entire Central Park episode. Everyone involved couldn't pick up the pieces from that 'crash and burn'.While it sounds like I am sitting here furiously upset with this film, I am not. I went into the film with high expectations, but was left with only medium results. Ferrell was funny, but not Ferrell-funny. He was scripted, almost to the point where you could count his beats. This was a holiday movie, but not one that will be played over and over again in this house. Overall, it was disappointing, but thanks to a little help from Dinklage, it seemed just a tad bit better. Grade: *** out of *****","

(Apparently this was originally intended to be a Jim Carey vehicle. I wonder if that would have made any difference...)","

","Elf, is a fun Christmas film starred by one of the most famous comedians, Will Ferrell. I remember seeing this movie on November 22nd for my dad's birthday after we saw Master and Commander and I was expecting this film to be a very stupid holiday film but it was far from that. It was actually really creative and joyful, just like all Christmas movies should be. This movie really put me into the Christmas cheer and I was very ready for it. I remember posting this comment like 6 months ago but it got deleted and I haven't posted it again since then and so now here I am posting it once again. Overall, this film was really good and when it releases this Christmas I will definitely rent it.Hedeen's outlook: 8/10 *** B","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875694/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875694,10," One of the funniest movies ever!! Great Quotable Lines!
","I saw this movie the day before Thanksgiving, and I couldn't stop laughing, it was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! There are many numerous quotes in the movie that make you want to repeat them over and over, like when answering the phone, ""Hello, this is Buddy, what's your favorite color??"" and a 1000 others! I am looking forward to owning this DVD so I can memorize all the lines in the film! AND WHAT A GREAT CAST!Philosophy: Get in the Christmas Spirit!! And laugh a lot!! Have Fun! And LOVE other people even if they don't deserve your love!!SOME SPOILERS: The North Pole scenes were great, they were a tribute to all the old puppet animation Christmas movies of the past, like Burl Ives ""Frosty the Snowman"", and ""Rudolph the Reindeer"". It brought back fond memories. Buddy leaves the North Pole and goes to New York City, and meets the real world, which brings lots of laughs at both NYC and Buddy's fish-out-of-water experience. (He is like an alien just arrived on Earth who can't fit in, and it is funny! I know that experience first hand myself.)He finds his real-life dad, who doesn't want a weird 30yr. old son showing up, but Buddy shows so much love, that eventually everyone who gets to know him, begins to love him. He is child-like, and gentle, and VERY LOVING to everyone, always thinks well of others, and puts other people first! If only everyone in the world were nice and sweet and thought of others first like Buddy! And he is FUNNY! He has strange habits he picked up at the North Pole living with Santa and the Elves, like eating only sugar, syrup, candy canes, and other sweets. It is hilarious watching him eat, and drink soda, and bake, and making paper snowflakes, and... well just everything he does is AMAZING and HILARIOUS! You have to see the movie to believe it!! GO SEE IT!At the end, it becomes bittersweet, Buddy is misunderstood by his dad, and in a scene straight out of ""It's A Wonderful Life"", he goes to a bridge to jump, but instead of Clarence the angel showing up, Guess WHO?? Santa Claus flies right over the bridge and distracts Buddy the Elf. Santa and Buddy reunite, and give jaded New Yorkers the Christmas spirit, and Buddy's father and half-brother and step-mom bond and love one another. And I won't tell you what else!!!!!The songs in the movie are great, the soundtrack was wonderful. Zooey (Buddy's girlfriend) has a beautiful voice, and her duets in the locker room and the closing credits I thought were the highlights of the film. Guess What?? The director of the movie, Jon Favreau, is in the film! Can you guess which part? Hint: He tests Buddy while Buddy eats cotton balls! The snowball fight scene was wonderful, putting the star on the Xmas tree was hilarious. Redecorating the room at Gimbel's was magical, and Buddy fighting the fake, smelly, Evil Bad Santa was GREAT!I gave this film 10/10 because it was the funniest movie of 2003 (even funnier than ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Pirates OTC"", and because I just fell in love with the film and all it's characters! And the songs! And the Quotes! Standout actors: Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, little step-brother, and of course, Will Farrell. It is his best role by far! This movie grossed almost $200 million at the US box office, so a lot of people liked it. I saw it twice myself!","

","Will Ferrell is excellent in Jon Favreau's charming comedy. This is tale of Buddy (Ferrell) a human raised by elves. When Buddy is told he is not an elf he goes in search of his father in the big city. Now while this may sound like a corny, children's x-mas movie, this is brilliantly pulled off and genuinely funny throughout. In the cinema I found myself along with many adults laughing just as much as the children. A lot, of the comedy is down to Will Ferrell's portrayal of Buddy of which i do not know of an actor that could do better. This is definitely one of the best x-mas comedies and a must see.","

While not roll on the floor laughing like the usual Will Ferrell material, it does provide a few out loud chuckles. It also does a good job catering to multiple age groups.

","Elf is an absolutely genius comedy that appeals to both adults and kids. Will Ferrell plays the title character with deft precision.  It's fair to say no other actor would have been able to pull off this role.  If Jimmy Caan (playing the long lost father) and the love interest (Zooey Deschanel) had been the least bit compelling, this might have been one of the five best movies of 2003.  I know most would say it's a stretch, but I firmly believe it.","

","Now I am a big fan of Will from all his work on SNL, so went to see this film with much hope after the disappointing Old School. After seeing the film, I must say that I was impressed, in particular by Will's character. Only Will could pull off the character as the adopted human/elf creature he plays in the movie so well and although the second half is cheesy to say the least, it is the early scenes with Will in the North Pole that stay memorably funny in my mind. One highlight was when he got randomly run over by a car in New York.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875688/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875688,8," Brand New Christmas Staple
","""Elf"" from actor/director Jon Favreau is a delightful holiday movie which benefits greatly from a strong comedic performance from Will Ferrell in his first solo lead role.An orphaned baby on Christmas Eve crawls into Santa's sack without his knowledge and is taken to the North Pole. When discovered it is decided that the toddler will stay and be raised as an elf but as the years pass he realizes that he is different from everyone else and sets out to find his biological father who works as a children's book publisher in New York. And then as they say the fun begins.The humor is not aimed squarely at children which makes it the perfect family comedy and not at any moment does Favreau play down to a younger audience.Ferrell is the perfect choice for the title role. He's not over the top like Jim Carrey or smug like Mike Myers. He brings a childlike innocence to the movie but never delves into the juvenile.The production design in the North Pole sequences are quite schizophrenic with differing styles but somehow it all gels together due to familiarity. Familiarity is the key to this movie. It's a completely new story but with characters, settings and situations you know from years of watching Christmas movies and holiday specials.My bet is that ""Elf"" will also become a Christmas staple much like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Home Alone"". You'll look forward to seeing it again and again in the future at year's end.","

","This review contains spoilers.This movie had it's ups and downs, it had some scenes which were really OTT and some unnesessary looonnngggg scenes that dragged on, but all in all i liked it, it's one of those movies that makes you feel full of life after watching it. I'm not a really a kids comedy/xmas movie kind of guy but some of the scenes with the elf had me laughing ie- worlds best coffee (OMG CONGRATS GUYS), the dwarf getting owned and the elf using the couch as a trampoline to get to the top of the tree, GOLD.A couple things i didn't like were the relationship between the chick and the elf, i mean wtf he was waiting outside her shower, they had NOTHING in common and he acted like a complete retard, but they fell in love and had kids? o. k.second/third things are related to the ending, the retarded nature of the 'central park rangers' was realllyyy stupid. ""HEY MAN IM GOING TO KILL YOU CAUSE YOU WON'T GET ME STUFF FOR XMAS"", it seemed kind of dumb but i ignored that and hoped for the best, another thing is - the whole xmas carol singing thing, i can't be bothered to go into detail so on the whole it was really stupid but it didn't ruin the movie.I would have really liked to see more of the father's career, they kind of killed it off and it seemed like a last resort for the writer(s).I would recommended this as a family/kids movie but if you are a dull person who is fixed on reality this isn't for you. 6/10 cause it doesn't appeal to everybody's taste, but it's cool none the less.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875679/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875679,NA," Fun light-hearted film with a good soundtrack that all ages should enjoy
","I saw this film a few days before Christmas 2003 when it was in the theatres. I took two children, a boy aged 9 and a girl almost 10, as well as another adult.  We all loved it!Buddy (Will Ferrell) as a baby in an orphanage accidentally ends up in the North Pole when he climbs into the bag of Santa (Ed Asner) to play with a teddy bear. Once Buddy is found, Santa and the elves decide to raise him as an elf and Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) becomes his father. Clearly something is wrong when Buddy towers over his peers and just doesn't have the innate toy-making and other abilities that the elves do.  He's told that he is actually a human being, and his real father, Walter (James Caan) works in Manhattan - and is on Santa's ""naughty"" list.The story of Buddy's returning to Manhattan is a delight for children and adults alike.  Bob Newhart brings his typical understated comedy to the role of Papa Elf that he made popular in TV shows from the 1960s through 1990s, such as ""The Bob Newhart Show"".  Santa doesn't play a major part in this film, but Ed Asner was ""the man"" to bring to life a reasonably jolly but bit ""fluster-able"" character.Buddy's enthusiasm and sappy sweet optimism is filled out with remarkable scenes of his speed and agility in working with Christmas decorations and snowballs, as well as a delightful relationship he builds with the lovely Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).  I loved the music, especially the duet of Zooey and Leon Redbone in ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"", as well as Ella Fitzgerald's ""Sleigh Ride"" and Eartha Kitt's ""Santa Baby"".  And the scenes with Santa's sleigh were exciting to see!This is a fun and relaxing film for all ages to get into a holiday mood or just to smile anytime of the year.  Young children should particularly enjoy the costumes and Buddy's antics, and I would think that all but the most jaded would find ""Elf"" to be a light-hearted and fun film with a good, retro soundtrack.  Jingle bells!   --Dilip, Christmas 2003","

","When I first saw the Elf trailers, my initial reaction was ""oh great, this looks pretty bad"".  Judging from the low quality of the trailers and the fact it was opening up on the same weekend Matrix Revolutions was opening I had little faith in this film.  But after watching it actually take out the titan it shared a weekend with and continue to stay near the top combined with the positive reviews and excellent word-of-mouth I decided to see what made Elf so special. Well, what I can basically say about Elf is that it takes almost every single Christmas movie cliche and throws it together to make a two hour movie.  We have the ""disgruntled man who needs to be shown Christmas spirit"", ""Santa is unable to deliver presents so main character must help him"", plus with a sappy ending that reeks of positive spirit.  But what I believe prevented this from turning into another I'll Be Home for Christmas is that Will Ferrell shows so much potential as a comedian and as an actor and his performance did save this film.Of course, many of the good jokes were spoiled in the trailers which I personally hate when it comes to any comedy so that did impact my perception of Elf's humour a lot.  But what I was seen for the first time was very humourous and the way that Ferrell brings the Buddy the Elf character to life is amazing.  All he needs is one consistantly good film and his career will take off, I guarentee that.  I'm saying that because I only see potential in Ferrell, Old School was too short and the jokes were badly paced while this one just feels like another Christmas movie.  Considering the immense success of Elf however, I can honestly say we will be seeing that one film very soon as demand for Ferrell goes up.  The choice to make James Caan the father of Buddy was a pure genius move since Caan still has the ability to make his character seem rough around the edges, (though his ""good ending"" was a little forced).  A lot of Ferrell's scenes clicked and many of his jokes did indeed hit and that is what I feel makes Ferrell so gifted.Basically, what I'm trying to say is that Elf is a basic Christmas movie with little surprises but Ferrell's performance truely shows his potential.6.5/10","

","Will Ferrell is a comic genius. Only somebody with his talent could develop naive Buddy the human elf into a great family film. The film is done with a lot of heart and sometimes is even corny but it is a great family film. There is rarely expletives or violence in the film. Will steals this film easily from stars like James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, and Bob Newhart. If you're looking for a good holiday movie without any preaching, this is it. I wish Artie Lange was doing more acting like this than the Howard Stern show. He is an untapped comic genius in his own right. Artie Lange is the John Belushi of our generation and sadly he has some of the same problems. Will Ferrell is worthy of the success. He is brilliant, likable as Buddy. How can you not love him after seeing him in this film? If you're a fan of SNL, you will know why there are volumes of his best work. He is simply incredible comedic genius and we love him at our house.","

","This movie was terrible. Ferrel shouldn't have signed on to this movie. He did good to the movie, but the movie did nothing in return to or for him.
Most of the funny parts were only slapstick comedy style, and I only laughed for a few seconds because the writers tried to add something to the end of the joke which made it completely unfunny.I went with my friend to see this movie a few weeks ago. He only laughed once. I laughed a few times... but not at the movie... just at what he yelled out loud... and at some of what Will Ferrel said.I  do not understand why people like it so much. It may be a family movie, but what makes it so special? Answer: NOTHING AT ALL.I'm just going in circles here, so here it is.All in all... Family comedy (It IS supposed to be funny, right?). Mediocre. Writers could have done so much more with the plot. Slapstick and stupidity is most of the so-called ""comedy"". Will Ferrel was the only funny part.Recommendations: A mom or dad (or both) with young children. A critic that was forced to review the movie. An average Joe that has a funny friend with him (or her) to see it.","

","The last time I saw stop-motion on the big screen was 2000's CHICKEN RUN. Will Ferrel (SNL and THE OBLONGS) plays a human raised by elves. He is like a little kid in the real world. The humor is good. ""The Clausometer is going down!"" ""Hey Buddy. Wanna play?"" ""Not now Arctic Puffin."" There were some gross scenes apart from his loud belch. The scene where he eats spaghetti with chocolate syrup, and chocolate pop tarts, and m&ms. YECH! Try drinking coffee with ketchup, or hamburger with sugar. What would the Society of Orthodontists and anyone who is allergiced to candy will say about this? This is totally homaging/spoofing Rankin Bass. The Chiodo Brothers (KING COBRA and the 90's version of LAND OF THE LOST) are responsible for the stop-motion scenes. Speaking of stop-motion, Ray Harryhausen, legendary stop-motion animator who had his name on the walk of fame on June 2003 supplies the voice of a young polar bear cub. Read this stop-motion lovers. And now here what I got to say about stop-motion in the 21st Century. Alas we are in the 21st century. We saw this special effect since 1908 in HUMPTY DUMPTY'S CIRCUS. And we thrilled by seeing it used in special effects like CLASH OF THE TITANS. But now thanks to CGI it is no longer used in special effects. It is used in cartoons, commercials, and in home movies. We are witnessing it fade away. But we can keep it alive by using it in our home movies. Happy 95th Anniversary Stop-Motion. Besides this film is better than those SANTA CLAUSE movies with Tim Allen. Don't you think.","

I do have one major gripe about this movie though, its production design (in the North Pole scenes). Its blatantly obvious it was low-budget, to me it had little charm, only the actors did that. I especially loathed the awful animatronics, the kind you'd see on a day-time BBC kids program, cheap plastic toys made to look integral with the actors, it was a major setback in my opinion. I think its $30m budget should have been bumped to $40m, and it would have made for more charming and magically inventive sets. 7/10","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875618/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875618,8," Not for the overly cynical.
","Jon Favreau's ELF is one of those movies that the cynic in us wants to hate, but the child in us has the good sense to love. When it was over I wanted to clap, despite the fact that no one involved in the film would hear the applause, and I literally couldn't stop smiling throughout the entirety of the end credits. Yes, of course it's corny; it's about a man raised by Santa's elves. And, yes, it is rather predictable in that every character and plot nuance comes to its logical conclusion. Far-fetched? Obviously; it's about a man raised by Santa's elves! But ELF never pretends to be anything more or less than what it is: that most dreaded of cliches, a ""feel-good"" movie. Now, usually I am the first one to scorn corny, oversentimental art of any kind, and I have been known to (as Stephen King once phrased it) ""blow my nose"" on happy endings. Well, I went into ELF with a healthy dose of my usual cynicism, knowing only that anything involving Jon Favreau was, at least, sure to make me laugh once or twice. What can I say? ELF is funny, touching, and basically just fun in every possible way. Will Ferrel as Buddy: the perfect way for this great comic actor to become a star. In his first leading role, he carries this film like a plate of Christmas cookies. The ease with which he assumes the role makes you wonder if he really was raised by elves. James Caan is quite good as Buddy's human father, Ed Asner is the best Santa Claus ever put on film, and Bob Newhart is ... well, Bob Newhart, but the icing on the gingerbread cookie is Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the cute-as-an-elf human with whom Buddy falls in love. There is a youthful, exuberant beauty about her that makes you forget how painful love can actually be, and this beauty extends to her excellent voice, a key factor in the film's third act. Her acting, of course, is not put to the most rigorous of tests in this film, but is certainly strong enough for the role she plays. ELF is one of the best Christmas movie to come out since TRAPPED IN PARADISE. Avoid THE HAUNTED MANSION, THE CAT IN THE HAT, and probably any of the other big ""Kid's movies"" this season (except maybe the new HARRY POTTER), and see this with your family instead. Or see it alone; I did, and enjoyed every minute.","

","At a certain point, Christmas movies started getting dumb. They just ran out of ideas and we started getting films like Jingle All The Way. Elf is the first movie since Bill Murray's Scrooged to do some good for the holdiay's cinematic potential. It's made by smart people and this is an obvious fact that shows itself in every scene. Yes, the plot looks silly and uncreative. An elf is really a human and has to go find his real Dad. It looks dumb. Part of the fun of this movie is how big a surprise it is that it turns out to be great. It's not about plot. It's about humor. Every role is perfectly cast, every scene is designed in terms of achieving maximum comic potential, and Will Ferrell, who is ussually more annoying than not, has finally found the perfect role for his style of humor. This movie uses Christmas right and keeps us laughing so often that it's almost impossible to walk away unsatisfied.","

This movie rises heads and shoulders above earlier attempts at holiday fare (Santa Clause(s), Jingle All the Way, Grinch - Argh!) Elf is an instant classic.  The tone reminds me of ""A Chirstmas Story"" and Favreau knows how keeps the pace of the film moving right along. There are a couple of minor sub-plots in addition to the main story and they all work. Ferrell plays the Elf character sincerely and dead-on target which allows us to buy into the film's premise without any qualms. I am not sure if I would want to see Elf 2, but I will keep an eye on Will Ferrell and Jon Favreau. Also, be sure to watch Favreau's series, ""Dinner for Five"" on IFC!","

Will Ferrall is really the reason to see this film, i admire his work since SNL and since than, he has done a great job of making everybody wet their pants. Anywho, the film doesn't really concentrate on your average holiday movie, its more of finding the ones you care about. In the case, Elf finds his estrange father (james cann) after leaving the north pole and wants his father to accept him the way he is.
Nice comedy, not to stupid or subtle.
9/10","

","I decided to see this movie instead of the overhyped Cat In The Hat.  From what I read, I made a good choice.  I though Will Ferrell was funny on SNL (it has suffered in his absence) and he is funny here too.  I actually believed he was this oversized elf looking for his natural father.  And it turns out to be Sonny Corleone (actually James Caan, the actor who played Sonny in The Godfather though that would be a movie worth seeing).  Many people think Caan is miscast, but I don't agree.  Caan is a perfect cynic to Ferrell's believer.  The other interesting casting is Bob Newhart as an elf and Ed Asner as Santa Claus.  It's interesting to see them in a movie like this.  See this movie again and again.  7/10","

","This isn't a full review, I just wanted to point out the one thing about this movie that I thought was annoying -- the product placements.  It starts out at the North Pole with the Monopoly games, Barbie Dolls, Etch-a-Sketch toys, and it just got worse. There was a bottle of Coca-Cola, a box of Pop-Tarts, a jar of M&Ms, Lite-Brite toys, and Legos. Oh yeah -- I forgot the Isotoner gloves and the authentic NFL jersey. I'm sure that I have even forgotten a few.  This movie was over the top in terms of the number of product placements, it really became distracting after a while.The positive comment that I will make is that it was fun to see Andy Richter and Kyle Gass get bit parts.","

","First off, I think Will Ferrell is extremely talented and is no doubt going to become a very successful comedian and hopefully ELF will be looked upon as a launching pad for his career. I didn't have THAT many problems with Elf- mainly is that I never thought it was hilarious. It made me laugh in some scenes but the previews once again gave away too much.  I thought the begining started out very promising but dropped about halfway through.  The ending (involving Santa and the chase scene in Central Park) didn't seem to fit the movie. But anyways, I wouldn't say ELF is a waste of time, just not the ""HOLIDAY CLASSIC"" everyone is talking about. If you really want a funny, good hearted comedy go see ""SCHOOL OF ROCK"".Thanks","

","Who knew that it would take the writer of SWINGERS to direct the latest Christmas classic?  At the top of this, I would like to thank Jon Favreau for pointing out that Bob Newhart will never go out of style.  Mr. Favreau brings a breezy swirling-cocktail style to this project.  The homages to the classic Christmas tv of the 60's and the sight of Will Farrell in yellow tights makes for one of the best Christmas movies since George C. Scott assumed the role of Ebenezer Scrooge.  No one but Mr. Farrell could have pulled this off, and no director could have made the movie seem hip, other than Mr. Favreau.  And, to boot, it has one of the best and most exciting ""Santa and the reindeer"" scenes ever put on film.","

It didnt have anything inappropriate or lewd.  At the same time though it appealed to the older audience members too, which, at 10:00, was the majority.  Ferrell had a solid performance, marked with his usual over-the-top style. It has great writing for a childrens movie, nothing too deep, but enjoyable. Quotes have found their way into many conversations at school, so it isn't just a kids movie. Notable appearances include KG and Andy Richter as writers.

Annual viewings will be a must.Incorporating elements from the stop motion christmas specials of our youths, paying homage to George Bailey's contemplative bridge scene -- and even employing little Ralphie as an Elf - all master works of some genius powers that be.We won't even discuss the movie version of ""The Grinch"", but how about allowing Jim Carrey to redeem himself starring as George Bailey in a remake of ""It's a Wonderful Life""? The Donna Reed part would be fittingly played by Reese Witherspoon. I realize it's treading on sacred ground here to even consider recasting the movie, but why not?It would be great to see a resurgence in well done holiday movies, perhaps even claymation specials, and I don't mean cheesy sequels like ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year""...where are the great stories and writers out there? Where are the people with the imagination? ""Elf"" is a good start, but what's next?There is a CGI movie playing in the IMAX format called ""Santa vs. the Snowman"", but it just doesn't even sound appealing.","

","So I saw Elf opening day in a crowded theater (and when I saw crowded, I mean people standing at the sides crowded). And I'd have to say that Elf was everything I had expected it to be, but with a little extra.*WARNING:A FEW SPOILERS*It followed the basic guidelines of every good-and corny-holiday movie. The over worked parent, the attention deprived kid, and the unexpected visitor that seemed to show up right at the nick of time, were all included. And everyone would have seen it as another feel good Christmas fantasy designed specifically to get you in the ""Christmas spirit"", if it hadn't been for Will Farrel.The corny lines, the unrealistic circumstances, and the overly fantasized Santa sightings all made their appearance in this movie, but the absolutely hysterical character Buddy the Elf made the numerous ""did he actually say that?"" lines more than worth it. While most of the other characters didn't exactly make you want to stand up and clap, Will Farrel certainly made tears form in your eyes, but not because you were unhappy. I personally came out of the theater still giggling under my breath with the image of Buddy running head long into the Christmas tree in attempt to get the star on the top fresh in my mind.Still, most (if not all) of the funny parts were already shown in the trailer, so the best part was just waiting for them to happen. I found myself nudging the person next to me when I recognized the part coming up. Although I had seen it time and time again, the atmosphere of the entire theater doubled over laughing made it almost three times funnier than it had been on a computer screen.The bottom line: It had the ho-hum and predictable plot with the corny lines, but the abnormally tall elf/man with the wierd felt hat and the pointy shoes made you want to stand up and say ""Bravo!""","

","This past weekend I had to sit through two hours of dreck in Beyond Borders. ELF more than does the job of uplifting my battered movie-going spirits! This is a great movie! Ferrell is great, the story is great, and I absolutely loved the tongue-in-cheek nods to those old Rankin/Bass Christmas specials we past-30-folks grew up on.  ""Leon The Snowman""?! Give me a break, what a hoot!Like others have said, I don't think anyone but Ferrell could have brought the kind of innocent, childlike, borderline-weird quality that's perfect for the role.  He's the star and everyone else is backup, well, except for the great script and visual direction, especially early on in the film. 
Overall, a wonderful experience as the Christmas season draws near.","

","A must see for parents & children. The casting is brilliant. Will Ferrell as Buddy the Christmas Elf (the part gives Ferrell the opportunity to showcase his sincere, honest, strange, quirky comedic style), Ed Asner as Santa Claus, James Caan plays the Buddy's biological father (which allows Caan to play his traditional straight-laced, tough-guy character) & Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive Elven father (in which Newhart displays his classic dry-wit). The film features ""knock-offs"" of the classic Christmas specials which the older movie-goer should immediately recognize.Elf is destined to be on the shelves of tv & family rooms across the nation as a holiday favorite for years to come.","

","Alright, alright. I know... It's a kids movie... Well, it's the best one I have seen in a long time. Sure it seems to lean towards a younger audience,but there are plenty of adult treats thrown in that will most likely buzz right over the little ones heads. Only Will Ferrell could pull the role of Buddy off. I couldn't picture any other actor in the world playing that part. Well, maybe Brian O'Halloran. Anyways, he was excellent.
**************POSSIBLE SPOILERS******************************* What I really like about this holiday film is that it gives a new classic for a new time and generation. A truly warm movie that I believe will be watched every Christmas by many a family for years to come. It brings a new sense of belief to the little ones by showing that Elves even make those Graphics Processor Chips that kids want for their computer so that they can play their favorite games. I loved the gross out scenes as well. I also learned that maple syrup goes with anything. ***************************END SPOILERS***********************All in all a solid Christmas movie.

","This movie was really very funny. The beginning scenes, with Will Ferrell living in the North Pole with other elves, was a bit corny, and I was wondering where exactly this movie was going. Fortunately, it went in exactly the right direction, and it had some fantastic comedic moments. Ferrell is hilarious as a hyper, super-polite elf who has no idea how to act in the human world. He is fascinated by glowing elevator buttons, terrified by an escalator, amazed at the size of human toilets, and basically awed by everything that normal people take for granted. The supporting characters are good too (especially Bob Newhart, who delivers all the goofy narration with a deadpan straight face), but Ferrell steals the show. He is a riot. I truly believe this movie could become a classic Christmas film. I could not help but like it, even though it was a little on the hokey side. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a fast, funny movie that anyone can enjoy. I give ""ELF"" 8 out 10 stars. Now, go see it.","

","I really didn't think Elf would be that great.  Yes, Will Ferrell stars in this movie as Buddy the Elf.  This Saturday Night Live alumni did wonders for the movie Old School.  Now he set his sights on a comical family/Christmas movie.  But I didn't know if the plot line would be that great.  Would it make me laugh so hard I spit out my $4 soda, or would I just be sitting there waiting to go home?  I guess I needed to go check it out to know for sure. Well the movie did not disappoint.  Sure, it had some of its moments where you were like ""that's so played out"", but most of the movie was full of happy Christmas joy.  Edward Asner was the perfectly cast Santa Claus, one of the best recent Santa castings.  James Caan as Buddy's father was very... what's the word... naughty.  You really despised his character for the most of the movie.  But that's what they were getting at.  And the biggest wow of the movie was Zooey Deschanel (Jovie).  She did an awesome awesome awesome job with the whole singing aspect of the movie.  She also was great in the acting aspect too.  She's the type of girl I could see myself hanging out with, which is a good thing because I love to relate to a character in a movie. This story was awesome.  One of the best written family movies in a while. School of Rock is the only family movie of the last few months which I think is written up to par with Elf.  You'll want to check Elf out if you are in the holiday spirit and ready for a laugh riot.  Watch it now, and then check it out again once Christmas hits.  You'll really enjoy that.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0875520/?ref_=tt_urv,elf,rw0875520,8," A fun holiday film with a lot of heart and laughs
","Elf stars Will Ferrell as Buddy the elf in this fun holiday film. The story is rather simple; Buddy when he was a baby crawled into Santa's bag at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Santa found buddy once he returned to the North Pole and didn't want to return Buddy to the hospital since Buddy's parents put Buddy up for adoption. As he grows he is told that he was a human who has been raised by Elves and that he was adopted. Buddy then sets out to New York City to find his dad (James Caan) and spread the holiday spirit.
I feared going to see this film but when I walked out of the film I was not only happy to have seen the film but was also rather touched. The movie from the trailers looks like nothing more than a silly movie where some big elf travels to NY and gets hit by cars and falls and continues to do this throughout the film. However to my surprise this was not the movie that I thought I was seeing. Buddy the elf is a very funny and lovable character. Will Ferrell plays the character well and you really feel for him as a character.  It is a real pleasure to watch him on the big screen for the whole 1 hr and 35 minutes of this film. James Caan also comes in to this movie, as I guess in this movie you would call the Scrooge character. The film's other highlight character to me is the lovely Zooey Deschanel, who is Buddy's love interest in the film. I am a big fan of Zooey Deschanel and to me its not fair her career hasn't taking off yet. She was the highlight of many movies I have seen in the past including the Good Girl, Big Trouble, All the real girls, and Almost Famous. I guess what I am really getting to is the cast of this film was perfectly cast.The humor of this film was a lot of slapstick style humor however thankfully no fart jokes, which was another big surprise for me. The humor sometimes in this film is in the dialog and not everyone catches the laughs. It's not all sight gags here. The film also is very beautiful. The views of New York City and the Christmas stores have a real Christmas feel to them just as if you were in New York City for Christmas. The director Jon Favreau did a great job on this film.  The problem with this film could be this, it's not really original, and it uses scenes we have all seen before in movies but the question I ask is that necessarily a bad thing? Not all the time as long as the script is good and tries to be original at times and is not a carbon copy of another movie. Elf does have scenes of movies we have seen before but it also has some things that are original, which is where it counts. This isn't a academy award winning film, it's a holiday comedy. So in conclusion, I thought I would hate Elf because of the way they marketed the movie but after long doubt and reading endless amounts of good reviews for this film, I took my brothers and we went to see Elf. It was a funny, pleasant, and heart felt movie, which I think, would soon become a Christmas classic like Scrooged, The Christmas Story and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. Elf is fun and touching and when you walk out of this film you will feel good. I highly recommend this film to not only kids but also to adults and anyone who wants to jump-start their holiday spirit. My final rating for Elf is an 8/10.","

After he grows to be twice the size of the other elves, he finds out that his biological father (James Caan) lives in New York City.  With his child like innocence, Buddy sets out on a long journey to find his father, and when he does, his father is like Scrooge and his stepbrother (Daniel Tay) doesn't believe in Santa.  Buddy can't understand why his new family and the people of New York City have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas.  Buddy works to bring back the Christmas spirit.  Buddy helps his brother win a snowball fight against some bullies in Central Park, and they become true brothers.  Next, he decorates the Santa Claus room at Gimbel's and meets a beautiful girl (Zooey Deschanel).  The Christmas spirit returns to New York City when everybody sings a Christmas song in Central Park. Kids will love this Christmas story and it will be enjoyable to parents. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:35, Rated PG) 6/10","

","So a few weeks ago my 20-something-year-old male friend mentioned how much he wanted to see this new movie Elf that was coming out and starring Will Ferrell.Immediately I cringe inwardly, but nod my head and mention that I vaguely recall seeing something about that film on TV somewhere. Wasn't James Caan in it too? Hmm. Maybe it could be good. Heh.. maybe.A little over a week later and this said friend is giving me a call. We decide to make plans for Friday, but why go out to eat again? After a few seconds of mentally listing the pros and cons of it, I just say it. I say, ""Didn't Elf come out today? Why don't we go see it since I know you want to."" A few hours later as we walk into the theatre, I'm praying that this movie will at the very least have more entertainment value than From Justin to Kelly. See? Not much in the expectations department.Okay, so to get to the point of all this.. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. It's slightly childish, slightly unbelievable, and very, very funny. I fell in love with it, and I cannot wait to be able to add it to my collection of DVDs so that I can pull it out every year around Christmas and get myself in the mood to start buying strands upon strands of Christmas lights.Will Ferrell is right at home as he prances across the screen in tights, picks used gum off railings in New York City, bounces across beds in department stores, and naively assumes midgets are elves. This film pays homage to other Christmas classics, it miraculously has a decent plot to it that, while cheesy, is cheesy in a very good way.In all honesty, I'm kind of hoping at least one of my other 20-something-year-old friends is interested in seeing this movie. Because I wouldn't mind seeing it again.","

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Jon Favreau (the greatness of ""Swingers"", also the doctor in ""Elf"") provides the seasons first touch of holiday spirit.  Will Ferrell is perfect as the wanna-be/thought-I-was six foot three elf.  This film works because it has a nice little story (actually a couple of them) that provide the framework for some classic comedy scenes.  The VERY attractive and talented Zooey Deschanel (""the Good Girl"" ""Mumford"") is very good as Buddy's co-worker and friend.  I am looking forward to seeing just how good of an actress she will become.  She has the look to play a love interest or the bad guy/girl role.  A wonderful supporting cast helps make this one work.  James Caan as the Scrooge character and Ed Asner as Santa are both perfect, as is Bob Newhart as Ferrell's adopted elf father.  The key role of Caan's son/Ferrell's brother Michael is played well by Daniel Tay (played Harvey Pekar as a kid in one of this year's best films ""American Splendor"").  Also nice to see Peter Dinklage (from another of this year's best films ""The Station Agent"") in a bizarre, yet brief role as an angry, children's writer for hire.  This is definitely one you can take the whole family to.  There were kids in the audience from ages 2 to 80.  Go with the Christmas spirit, as this is not Shakespeare!","

","I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months.  Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own.  I was not disappointed.  This movie was pure magic.  Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did.  There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come.  I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him.  However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics.  The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. 
It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours.  For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.","

","In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time.  However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child.  A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen.  The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times.  The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey.  I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did.  He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally.  I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here.  Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics.  However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.","

","Howard's 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a delightful family flick that both adults and children can enjoy (mostly with each other). It is basically an adaptation of the famous children's books and what the audience gets is a pleasant Christmas treat. Price's screenplay is brilliant as he cleverly manages to include some adult humour.The world of Whoville is beautifully constructed and created, full of colour, life, energy and spirit. The vivacious characters are full of positive energy and while it is over the top, it is all done within the context and none of it appears out of place. The CGI team and makeup crew deserve full credit for making the characters and settings so lifelike, bringing out a lot of detail and appearing authentic. The set designs are stunning and the cinematography is just as energetic as the characters.Child actress Taylor Momsen is absolutely. The cute dog also turns in a fine performance. Jeffrey Tambor, a very sexy Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon are first rate. However, what would 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' be without Jim Carrey? Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. It's a role that has Jim Carrey written all over it. The actor has immortalized the Grinch on screen.The movie itself is not an exact 100% adaptation of the book as there are a few changes. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. Other than the actors mentioned above, the rest of the cast hardly have anything to do than make fleeting appearances. Yet, 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a charming little Christmas family film that is dazzling to look at and hugely enjoyable with the whole family.","

Try not to lose sight of that ..if you do you really wont enjoy the movie...and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do..its not easy as it looks ...","

","I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, ""The Grinch"" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial.The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, ""Cindy Lou Who"" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further. His rhymes are fun to hear.I saw this in the theater, though it was ""fair,"" but on DVD, it was far better. I've seen in three times and it got better each time.","

","So whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes......This movie has really grown on me. I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. I saw the movies and owned the books as a kid and was given the books as a present in my 30's by my friend Amy Fidler. I loved the original movie so it made it hard at first to accept the remake but honestly, it has been well done. Jim Carrey is amazing and all of the other players rocked it. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars, however the new movie allows for much more cast/character depth and development. I have to admit, there's one scary scene here with the two main characters however I think you have to really let yourself go in order to experience the thrill. Bought it on the Playstation Network, can't wait to own it on Blu-ray. Narrater rocked it too.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594497/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594497,6," How the Grinch Stole the show!
","I agree completely, this film looks extremely overblown, and it is.Though the sets and costumes are visually amazing, they go by too fast too be truly appreciated, and there is the feeling that it is too much crammed into too little.  Besides this, the supporting cast have very little to do, and the presence of Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is rather puzzling.  Besides that, several weak story points are added, for instance, like the romance between the Grinch and Martha May seems completely superfluous.  However, if you want to see this movie, see for Jim Carrey, who steals the show as the title role.  He is simply hilarious!  He does, however, run a close race against Cindy Lou Who, who is unbelievably cute.The difference between this movie, and the cartoon, is that this movie is set more from the point of view of the Grinch.  In the cartoon, the Grinch is the villain, a grumpy old hermit who is jealous of the Whos and their happiness.  The Whos, in the cartoon, are just simple, country townsfolk celebrating Christmas, and when the Grinch finds he cannot destroy Christmas, he knows he cannot make them suffer the absence he feels in his life, and finally understands the holiday spirit. In the movie, however, the Grinch is a slightly more modern take on his character.  Actually, you can't blame him for wanting to do something about the Whos, who, in this movie, are a grim reflection of our society, and the crass consumerism and capitalism that yearly chokes the true meaning of the holiday spirit for material possessions.  The Whos are so immersed in their own greed that it almost seems they deserve it when the Grinch drops the ball on them.  The writers also make them seem as irritating and overly cheerful and loud as possible, with their gaudy decorations and foods, and creepy, sugar-coated style.  Cindy Lou's reaction to this is our own, and she and the Grinch find the real meaning of the holiday.  She and the Grinch are better seen as role models to today's holiday company, as a message not to lose ourselves in our own material greed that has become common to this holiday, but to instead remember what Christmas is.  I think this holiday would get a much better reputation if people made it a routine to imagine a Christmas without presents or trimmings every year, just to keep that image in mind.  But, if you don't want to be annoyed by the Whos, or blinded by the slightly overdone sets and costumes, watch it for Cindy Lou, or, if you don't like 'cute' movies like me, but like Jim Carrey's raunchy, slapstick, Marx Bros. style comedy, watch it for him.","

By grabbing hold of and finding the strength of the very merry, holly and jolly Christmas, he saves everyone's Christmas instead of stealing or ruining it. They make his Christmas the best one so far, and he makes the Christmas their best ever. By watching this with my grandfather, it really brought out the Christmas spirit in me. It really, truly did. It made my Christmas. The music in this movie brought it up, if just a little. It was nice, it was indeed. I am giving it 6 or 7 stars out of a possible 10.

","Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things (""Gossip Girl"") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.","

","Ask and Who, there's no place like Whoville around Christmas Day. Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.It could be because his head wasn't screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn't a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie ""Yes Man"" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it's fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger. She actually now is currently on the TV show ""Gossip Girl"" as Jennie Humphrey on Monday nights if you wanted to check her out in her role on the show or just see where she is now. This movie also stars Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Josh Ryan Evans, and Mindy Sterling. This is a good Christmas movie for the whole family to watch.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2536322/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw2536322,8," An amusing Christmas film that captures the imagination of Dr. Suess with Ron Howard's bold direction
","Ron Howard is known for making such dramatic films like Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons and many more, but before those two adaptations of Dan Brown's novels, he adapted the original book of the same from Dr. Suess, a remake of the 1957 cartoon ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"".The premise, like the cartoon, is the same: The Grinch plots to steal Christmas from all of Whoville, but learns that Christmas comes from the heart. This one, however, has a few tweaks that weren't included in the book. It details the Grinch's past about him being humiliated by the children of Whoville and has a relationship with Martha May Whovier. It wasn't the best origin, but wasn't that bad at all. While this movie stayed true to the spirit of the book (and despite it's crude and inappropriate humor but has a few good jokes) Jim Carrey, although over-the-top, did a perfect job as the Grinch. The rest of the cast did great especially Taylor Madsen as the lovable Cindy Lou-Who.I show some empathy for fans of the book who hated this adaptation, but as for me, I'm recommending this Christmas classic to others highly.Rating: 8.3/10","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594504/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594504,2," The 3 words that best describe this film are, and I quote, ""Stink! Stank! Stunk!""
","(possible spoilers)Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much betteruse of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). Sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!","

","How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period.All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.1/10","

Some of theother characters were good in their roles but if Jim Carrey had not been in this film it would have bummed out. Never the less the movie it self had a very interesting storyline but could never compare to the all time Dr. Suess classic. I realize they had to stretch thestory out in the movie considering it was an hour and a half long movie instead of a half an hour cartoon and they did OK. So if you haven't seen this movie yet see it if you like Jim Carrey because he did a fantastic job playing the grinch in this movie.,"

","This version of Grinch was a nasty feast I couldn't stand in the least.This full length high budget extravaganza really has little to offer beyond what the classic cartoon already did so well. Truly, the only good moments are those that are directly taken from the original story. The new material that is added here is simply a montage of misguided, mean-spirited, over-wrought highly intense noise; led by the master of hysterical yelling and screaming for no reason whatsoever, Jim Carry. No moral, no insight, no creativity, no entertainment value. We get some long-winded flap-trap about how mean the Whoville residents are to Grinch. How everybody else disturbed him emotionally etc. etc. ad infinitum, ad-nauseum. Be on the lookout also for subplots about some of the Who's, that are unnecessary, unfunny, and inappropriate. Christmas spirit does not exist in this movie (except in the portion that retreads the original story). Kids will be bored, adults will be annoyed. Any fan of Dr. Seuss's work will be offended.The actress playing Cindy Lou Who is about the only positive in this film. I realize she was a no more than two, and a nice character, but I kept hoping she'd push the Grinch off a cliff and mercifully end this disaster.Your heart will not grow three sizes the day you watch this. Stick with the classic cartoon.","

Now with this crappy movie it's: The Grinch rightfully hates XMAS because it's been over-commercialized by the selfish people of Whoville. Huh?!?!?! This is the complete OPPOSITE of Seuss' vision and his widow has the nerve to say it was what HE wanted?!?! This was the most overblown and over-hyped movie.

When we talked about it, I understood why. He had never read the book nor seen the wonderful cartoon versions--and the message in them is the exact opposite of this movie. So, if you haven't seen the cartoon or read the book, this could be a nice film to watch....but if you HAVE and loved them like I did as a child, the film is an insult.","

While the Grinch himself looks fairly good, the Who's look like demons! They even act like demons! They are nothing like Suess envisioned them to be. They don't even act like the Who's from the original book! The settings (while fairly large) have bleak colours (colors if you're American) and some appear as fairly ugly.

","This film had many things going for it: great original story, great cast, great potential for set and costume design, and great potential for makeup and special effects. Too bad Ron Howard didn't have the cohones or good sense to rein in Jim Carey's WAY OVER THE TOP performance or to get a better script. And this must be Ron's version of what a Tim Burton film should be, because much of the design is just plain creepy. While what had been a charming and heartfelt Christmas story here has turned into a frenetic, obnoxious parody of a holiday film now not fit for children. The original cartoon version is a MUCH BETTER version for children. Theodor Geisel (Dr. Suess) must be spinning in his grave somewhere and I can't imagine Mrs. Geisel (who approved this project on behalf of the Suess/Geisel estate) was thrilled with this film. So shame on you, Ron!","

","How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a great movie with a well written storyline and a good cast.It certainly made a few mistakes with adapting the classic Dr. Seuss book in to a live action movie,there are just certain elements to it that certainly could have been improved upon.It is a film lots of people like to watch at Christmas,and while I'll admit it is a fun movie,it dosen't really put me in to the Christmas cheer the same way movies like Its a Wonderful Life or the Santa Claus do.However,Jim Carrey as the Grinch is certainly a highlight,he's completely unrecognisable in this make up,but the characters personality and mannerisms remind us that it really is him under all that.I remember reading a review by Roger Ebert a few years ago in which he said that this movie focused too much on the meanness of the Grinch,and I would have to agree that this was a problem as we are suppose to feel sympathy for him,but it's hard when all we are seeing is why he's a bad person and seeing very little moments of kindness.It certainly made a few mistakes,but How the Grinch Stole Christmas is still a fun movie that brings the creations of Dr. Seuss to life,and I would recommend it to a family looking for a nice Christmas movie. An evil creature living near the cheery town of Whoville plans to put a stop to Christmas once and for all. Best Performance: Jim Carrey Worst Performance: Molly Shannon","

","Despite the misgivings one may initially have about Hollywood turning the still-satisfying animated TV special from Dr. Seuss' book into a big-budget live-action feature, fear not over the look of the piece. Director Ron Howard and his artists have really captured the visual essence of the classic show, and one couldn't possibly hope for a better-looking movie based upon a Seuss story. Jim Carrey is marvelously cast as the Grinch, a green, furry, Christmas-hating malcontent who lives atop a snowy hill overlooking Whoville, although the inhabitants of Whoville present a problem. With make-up designs causing everyone to resemble relatives of Wallace Shawn, distinctive (or likable) personalities were apparently difficult to come by. In expanding this whole scenario, screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic (some may argue, cloying) passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a self-serving jerk, a Christmas lights contest between neighbors, and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening; he becomes exhausted by the material itself--the bombast wears him out--perhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag (particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo, later munching on shattered glass). Bits and pieces work crazy magic, though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining (he's too anxious to be funny). Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion, and there are some marvelous scenes, but interest for adults should wane after the first hour. ** from ****","

","This quite possibly the worst movie Ron Howard has ever put his name on. I live action film based on Dr. Seuss's book would have been a good idea, if it had been executed better, and by a director more skilled at this type of movie.Ron Howard is not an untalented director, but this is not his type of film. He is not gifted at this type of ""whimsical fantasy,"" and it shows.  His effort at making this film work is apparent, as the sets and makeup are all very impressive, and evocative of Seuss's original illustrations. Ultimately tho, for all his effort, Howard's attempts to make all the disjointed parts of this film work falls short.The main flaws with this film lie in the script by Jeffery Price and Peter Seaman, and Jim Carey's misguided performance as the Grinch.  By expanding upon the story of the Grinch, the screenwriters could have done a much better job.  As it is, the fleshing out of the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who ends up coming off trite and forced.  I'm guessing the intent was to create sympathy for the Grinch, but his new backstory is rather cliched and comes off as uninspired.  The expansion of Cindy Lou Who's character is an admirable attempt to create a focal character at the other end of the spectrum from the Grinch, but by the end of the movie, despite the admirable attempt by Taylor Momsen, Cindy Lou Who has become a fairly annoying and irritating character.However, the true failure of this film lies in the hands of Jim Carrey's dreadfully awful portrayal of the Grinch.  Almost 180 degrees from the character's origins, the sullen, grumpy Grinch of the book and cartoon is replaced with a wise-cracking goofball who just happens to hate Christmas and the Whos.  The transition does not work.  Most of Carrey's scenes seem like they are meant to be funny, but end up being grating and unpleasant to watch.  The Grinch is so annoying in this movie, I find myself completely untouched when he has his change of heart at the conclusion.  Carrey's performance is irritatingly over-the-top, never letting down for a moment. This is not the Grinch I know, and as a result, it doesn't work for me. Carrey is definitely trying his best, but given the awful characterization of the Grinch he had been given, there's not much he could do to make the material rise above its own underachieving level.Overall, the film is unpleasant and not entertaining.  Watching it is more like an endurance trial than watching a movie.  I would not recommend this to anyone, especially anyone who loves the book and classic cartoon.My Rating (out of four stars): BOMB.","

","This movie was a disgusting, offensive, frivilous prostitution. Mean-spirited, superficial, and completely lacking any resemblence to the original story.  Has anyone ever READ the original story?  The point of Seuss' ""Grinch"" is not that the Whos are selfish weenies who learn how to be grateful after the Grinch steals all their Christmas.  THE POINT OF SUESS' GRINCH IS THAT THE WHOS ALREADY KNOW THAT MATERIAL GOODS ARE NOT THE POINT OF CHRISTMAS, AND THEY HAVE THE GIFTS AND GADGETS AS AN EXPRESSION OF WHO THEY ARE, ALREADY, INSIDE.  Jim Carrey is at his annoyingest; Ron Howard shows glaring deficiency in basic storytelling; and the general plot is gaudy and ridiculous, not to mention risque and offensive -- wife-swapping at the party?  The Who children brutally mocking and ostracizing the young Grinch?  The buxom Whoville sex-pot?  A ROMANCE STORY?  Give me a green latex make-up-covered break.  The sets, make-up, and camera work were obviously meant to be stunning and grand.  Instead they came across as exaggerated and trite.  The Grinch's bat-cave-like home?  The nauseating use of tilted camera shots?  And oh, wow, what great latex noses. Brilliant.I physically shuddered as this atrocity progressed.

","The live action Grinch is so over the top it makes the eruption of Vasuvius which burried Pompeii look like a tea candle. It has so much unnecessary slapstick ""humor"" that the 3 Stooges seem like the height of sophisticated humor. It is like getting hit in the face with a 100 lb sledge hammer. The delightful story we are used to is gone except for a few minutes near the end. The Whos are made out as stupid nit wits who are more interested in how much they can spend on gifts and what they will get in return that I really didn't care if the Grinch did steal Christmas. The only decent, feeling Who is the little girl, Cindy Lou. The young actress playing her is wonderful. The only other decent character is Max, the dog, and he steals the show. Jim Carry is NOT the Grinch. He is simply Jim Carry in a green fur suit with lots of make up. He does not know when to pull back and let the story work. He always goes way over the line. But this is also the fault of director Ron Howard. He could and should have made Carry pull back.To give credit where it is due, the make up, set design and special effects are excellent. Unfortunately, the children today, raised on the violent cartoons of Saturday morning TV, will think this is the real Grinch and the classic tale will take second place to this misconceived mess. It will, no doubt, make money and be shown over and over on TV in future years, but it will NEVER replace the wonderful original book and cartoon.","

","Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Much like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. The whole movie rings false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as George W. Bush is from rational, lucid thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.","

","There's nothing more distasteful than a movie that helps perpetuate the very evils it supposedly tries to protest.  With this live-action How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for instance, we have a movie that, like the original cartoon, tries to launch a thinly veiled attack on the American consumer culture.  But this movie is a product of the very same ridiculous excess that Seuss tried to discourage.  It is one of the most expensive movies of all time, to the extent that it may just barely turn a profit if it makes more money than any other movie this year, but a huge portion of its budget is completely wasted.  Why hire such expensive actors if you're going to hide them behind those awful rat-nose prosthetics?  Why hire the $20 million Jim Carrey and then render him unrecognizable with 40 pounds of latex (and do half his performance with CGI anyway)?  Why even make the movie in the first place with a script this grating and unbearable?Watching the film, I got the impression that it would have been infinitely better if it had been directed by Tim Burton.  Just look at Edward Scissorhands, or his stop-motion masterpiece The Nightmare Before Christmas--Burton clearly understands the bittersweet 'feel' of Christmas better than any other filmmaker in Hollywood.  But then, of course, I realized why they went with Ron Howard.  They obviously approached Burton first, but he replied, ""A live-action version of the Grinch!?  Are you guys NUTS?""","

The makeup effects are creepy, not cute; the Whovillians are anonymous drones -- and it doesn't help that they look like half pig/half human lab creations. Jim Carrey, who on paper seems like he would be perfect casting, overplays to the hilt, creating exactly the opposite effect to that inspired by the original droll creation of animator Chuck Jones and actor Boris Karloff. The only positive attribute Carrey could have brought to the film, that rubber face with which he could have created any number of comic moments, is buried underneath heaps of prosthetic makeup.This is a foul, terrible movie, and I can't believe that anyone could possibly like it.

Makeup and costume doesn't change that fact. I liked the Mask, but this is a different movie and a different character. A real actor wouldn't give the audience a repeat of old material.

","Since seeing Ron Howard's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I have been trying to come up with alternate titles to describe how I feel about it.  A few came to mind:  How Dr. Seuss Spins in his Grave, or how about How Opie Ruins a Classic.  I wish someone can explain how a book with less than 200 words can be made into a feature film.  Even after seeing this movie, I still don't understand.  Howard has always lacked an identity as a filmmaker and here he does his best imitation of Tim Burton.  The film is a cluttered mess that is endlessly boring due to some invented backstory of how the Grinch became the Grinch.  Like I need to know.  I firmly believe that if Dr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel) were alive today, he would have denounced the crude humor of Jim Carrey who prompts the mayor of Whoville to kiss his posterior by holding a piece of mistletoe up to his behind while leering at the cleavage of Christine Baranski. Shame on Audrey Geisel for whoring out her late husband's work to Hollywood. Shame on Jim Carrey for being so crude and destroying a classic character.

","I first saw this back in 2000 or 2001 i think. I gotta tell you it is funny. Jim Carreys facial expressions, attitude, voice, every thing matchs the ""Grinch"". The Whos are great and resemble the characters in the original story. Instead of a silent film with nothing but a narrator this one has acting and i did like the touch. It shows kind of the history of the Grinch and the other whos involved in his hate for Christmas. It does a good job at that. But is it as good as the original?? I don't think so, but what is out there today!If you want a holiday movie to get you in happiness tears and reminders of your childhood watch the original Grinch. If you want a great holiday laugh, watch Ron howards How the Grinch Stole Christmas. 6/10*","

","I cannot imagine that Dr. Seuss would have liked this movie if he was here to see it. The only common characteristic linking that fantastic little book and '66 special to this unfaithful pile of film is the title. First of all, this movie takes countless liberties for the sake of stretching the story out to an hour and a half. The classic line ""The Grinch hated Christmas/ The whole Christmas season/ Now don't ask why/ No one quite knows the reason"" is spoken in the film (by Anthony Hopkins, who does a great narration of the story the way it should be told), then contradicted entirely by a very clear summary of the Grinch's life. Then there's Whoville itself: In Ron Howard's movie, it's depicted as a corrupt, somewhat dark town of sex and alcohol. What book was Ron Howard reading?  There is no cynicism in Whoville! ""All the Whos in Whoville liked Christmas a lot."" Remember? Also, there is nothing in the book to imply that a shot of Christine Baranski's cleavage and Jim Carrey using the word ""bitchin'"" might help the story along. I won't even get into Jim Carrey's performance. TERRIBLE. He played himself, not the Grinch. The girl who played Cindy-Lou Who was cute and fit in with the story very well. Other than that, the movie sucked. Just watch the original and forget this was ever made.","

","After viewing ""The Grinch,"" there's little I can say positive about it. Personally, I've seen Ron Howard and Jim Carrey do better. This film takes away the main point of the children's classic and Chuck Jones' memorable television special. It's not the gifts. So why doesn't anyone in Whoville know that? Of course, you can't cram a half-hour animated classic or a short Dr. Suess story without using a creative license, right? And, ya see, sometimes that license should be revoked. This film focuses on the Grinch himself. What exactly makes him tick anyway? What's beyond that cheaply-woven costume and the yellow contact lenses? It's as if they turned ""The Grinch"" into a psychology film! It states that the Grinch was originally an orphan who grew up under two sisters (?) and decided to leave for Mt. Krumpet after being humiliated in class by the pudgy kid (the soon would-be mayor). Now, remember that cartoon they would run on NBC on Saturday Mornings once a year? The one where the Grinch meets the Cat in the Hat. Now then, the Grinch had a mother in that show didn't he? My point exactly. More faults - classic lines which made the book and the animated special classics are now gone and Cindy Lou Who who was originally two, appears to be at least eight here! This movie really was a huge disappointment.I do not recommend it for those of you who have grown to love the traditional Grinch.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594264/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594264,1," The worst movie of 2000 (spoilers)
","This adaptation of the classic Dr Seuss story is directed by Ron Howard, whose flair for stunning visuals is matched only by his full head of hair. This looks terrible.  The sets look like something I got free with a Happy Meal.  Remember the plastic rocks in the Flintstones movies?  They were quarried to make these sets.Ron Howard is a great director, but he hasn't got any unique style.  As much as I love Apollo 13, Backdraft and Ransom, they're not particularly exciting to look at.  He's just not the right director for something like this. Couldn't the idiot-execs look for someone else?  Tim Burton isn't the only guy in Hollywood with an imagination.  Okay, he probably is, but you'd think there'd be someone who can fake it better than Ron Howard.  In place of invention, we have only wonky camera angles.  `Hey, guys, put the camera on a 45 degree angle, that'll give it an other-worldly kind of look.'Jim Carrey, in the lead role, is as annoying as always.  Having toned things down for The Truman Show and even for Me, Myself and Irene, he's back to his old rule of comedy for The Grinch: loud = funny.  Look! at his arms flailing around wildly.  See! his face contorted into comical expressions.  Yawn! as you realise you've seen it all before.I haven't read How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so I can't say how this works as an adaptation, but I can say how it works as a movie.  It doesn't.  It doesn't work at all.  There's no magic, there's no awe or wonder.  And it gets the pace and the tone so wrong you'd think this was a first time director.  If this is how Ron Howard's movies are going to turn out from now on he'd better cross his fingers for a  Happy Days reunion.The plot, which is covered in 60-something pages in the book, is too thin for a hundred minute movie.  It is stretched more blatantly than Zsa Zsa Gabor's face.  The result is 50-tog padding, where the running time is allowed to drag at the expense of the pace.  The tone is lost completely. Most kids' movies have a few jokes that serve as a nod to the long-suffering parents in the audience, but the `adult' jokes here suggest that Whoville has racism, infidelity and wife-swapping parties.  Unbelievable.In place of charm, we get sentiment so cloying that tie-in sick bags would have been best-sellers.  The real meaning of Christmas isn't presents  it's about love, it's about being with friends.  The Grinch comes to realise this  an hour too late for my comatose backside  and celebrates Christmas in time for the finale.  Hooray!  We all come to realise that Christmas is about more than money and capitalism and commercialism.  The Grinch took more than 50 million dollars in its opening weekend. Merry Christmas, everybody!","

","The Review: Big budget remake of the beloved Dr. Seuss cartoon about a grumpy green creature intent on sabotaging Christmas by stealing it from the unsuspecting, kindhearted townsfolk below.I'm going to take a quote from one user's post:This is a very good film. Better than the animated original.With all due respect to that reviewer, I'm going to put a variation to that quote:This is a very bad film. Completely inferior to the animated original.For me, the animated Grinch special was a special part of my childhood, and yes I proudly count myself amongst the diehard loyalists who border on the word ""nerd"", that had a genuine dislike for this movie. Granted, it really is difficult to take a cartoon and spin it into an hour and a half feature, but the way this film is shot, is completely obnoxious in every sense of the word. You get the feeling that Carrey and Howard weren't proud of this film as it caused them to betray their artistic sensibilities in favor of a really big paycheck. ""The Grinch"" is a far inferior live action remake/adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss character where it's lead character is an obnoxious buffoon, it's Jim Carrey in green makeup. Jim Carrey living up to his persona of being Ace Ventura. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Carrey, but I can honestly say I despised this movie 100%. ""The Grinch"" is a movie that feels genuinely fake, where you can't take yourself away into imagination and fantasy because all you really see on screen is just a bunch of movie sets and some makeup, there's no connection to the material that makes it feel like the cartoon. It's baseless commercial dreck that was only a bore.","

And to add the icing on the cake, what about an actual Whoville Village filled with actual running stores and candy shops at Universal Studios, YEAH!!

","Oh, good, Ron Howard and Jim Carrey are getting together for a remake of the Grinch! This is going to be movie magic. I loved the Grinch on TV! What-a-dis-a-point-ment! I usually love Ron Howard directed movies. And Jim Carrey movies are some of my favorites. This movie never gets off the ground. For starters, the town's people just don't translate well from the cartoon form. The mayor is just boorish and boring. Cindy Lou-who, so cute and innocent in the cartoon, has too many silly lines and dull scenes. I never bought the idea where the Grinch is honored by the town. Ron Howard should have realized that many people who take their kids to the movie, also watch the movie with them. I guess the standard set by the beloved cartoon could not be met by the movie. The movie sets are more goofy than charming, and so is Jim Carrey's performance. He had his moments, but weighed down by a bad script and a bad costume, he failed to add to my holiday cheer. You're a bad one, Mr Grinch!","

","Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox","

","A loud, chaotic, unrealistic book adaption that I only got through because I was reading something at the same time.  Only seven minutes in do I realize that this is going to be a long morning.  Noisy, unreal scenes abound the first 20 minutes, with ""people"" (or whatever the ""Whos"" were) running about town, practically throwing their money at a store clerk and dashing off, then people crowding a post office counter in hyperspeed yelling for assistance.  Then the introduction of Carrey, the title green geek who's constantly contorting his mouth and inflecting a Sean Connery like accent. You thought Carrey mugged in other films?  Oh, man, look out here. Twisting, turning, dancing, putting emphasis on meaningless dialogue.  Which is another glaring issue.  How could you not take classic lines from a book and make a good movie?  Cuz writers Price and Seaman have severely altered the original story, and left only a few bits from the book for Anthony Hopkins to narrate.  The new material just isn't funny or interesting, and the characters too cartoonish to enjoy.  The singing interludes are painful as well.  Plus the Grinch is pretty sinister.  Who knows why any kid would go for this.  Everything was put into production design and making the Grinch as depressing a villian as possible.  I'd bet there are portions that would probably scare kids, especially the moment where a little girl is trapped in a machine which is about to squash her with a packing lable. Released during the key Thanksgiving thru Christmas period helped it make $259 million bucks.  But I was glad to see the budget was $123 million so their gross wasn't as great as it could've been.","

Taylor Momsen is the best part as Cindy Lou Who, although I miss the adorable two year old from the original. This Cindy Lou is a typical ""smarter than all the grown-ups"" kid like you only see in movies. Still, overly precocious or not, she's one of the few sweet parts of an otherwise charmless film.

","In 1966 a great half hour of television was aired near Christmastime.  It was the original How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and it was a warm and flaming work of art, in prose, poetry, and form. Two years ago it was remade into the most contrived film in a long time. One must give Howard's film the credit that it was well imagined--the landscapes were grand, the makeup was well-done (thank you Rick Baker), and Carrey was as eccentric as ever.  But... The film failed horribly as a story.  The cinematography was childish (not that one should expect grandiose cinematography in a family film).  The plot was butchered, with the origin of the Grinch, a far-too-long delving into how the Grinch came about (a key party, no less), and a bad shave.  This simply wasted time. The movie was too much like Space Jam.  It took good characters and made them nothing more than billboards.  Suess' storybook fantasy was bastardized, and Universal made millions. This is what is wrong with Hollywood. Go rent the original, you'll be doing the kids a favor.","

","This an appalling movie: either a cynical cash-in of the beloved TV special or a delusional misfire. Either way, is it shockingly poorly made. The set direction looks like remnants from Pee-wee's Playhouse. The cast (beyond Carrey and Hopkins) dips into TV second bananas. The script is obviously stuffed with more filler than bad dog food. The pace all feels wrong--there are times of almost excruciating slowness or just plan inanity. Jim Carrey can not carry (sorry) this movie. It seems like he's struggling to put his stamp on the Grinch and Howard offers no help. Speaking of Howard, I actually saw a clip if him comparing this movie to ""The Wizard of Oz."" What audacity! Combined with a sledgehammer marketing campaign to reap in the bucks now repeated with the video/DVD release,  I feel insulted that a perfectly good piece of entertainment (the original Grinch) has been co-opted. This is nothing new--remember ""The Flinstones."" I say, unless you come with an idea of your own--don't bother.","

The actors loked horrible with their makeup.  The first hour was a painful experience to sit through.  The first hour was the Jim Carey show and I did not pay to see Jim Carey walk around in the Grinch costume talking in a Sean Connery accent.  I paid to see The Grinch and it was nothing like it.  Where was the cheer?  Where was the colorful Whoville?  Why did Whoville look like a nightmarish place??? Your guess is as good as mine.,"

","That was too ugly to stand. (Jim Carrey) was at some kind of a turning point between being that crazy cartoon channel, and a bit sane comedian / actor. Here he selected to be the wacky wacko Carrey. Although he's brilliant, but NOT THIS TIME ! The whole deal is so strange; metamorphosing everybody's image transformed the movie's world into big monster for ever mysterious reasons ! So, it's not your typical fairytale's soft drawings but, in the same time, not a wild black comedy or a satirical take on our modern life's towns and people either ! This movie suffers from just too much of everything bad I suppose : hideous make-up, repellent lenses, nasty humor, in one word this is not the way to make a kids fantasy, it's the new way for making pure ugliness under the name of novelty, uniqueness, whatever. And even with the wise tone of (Anthony Hopkins) as the narrator nothing could bring any balance to this kids' story which gone queer. Even as a drama it's lousy; ask yourself simply why the lead got changed at the end ? Clearly for nothing but the movie makers' desire ! In fact they expended all the time, the efforts, and the money for building this huge crappy set pieces, and forgot about the story, relying on the fact that the audiences will laugh and be dazzled more than to think : aka Hollywood everlasting mean trick, but that was out of the question, because I didn't laugh, be dazzled, and more than once I found myself thinking furiously ""what the hell is that ?, what they were thinking ?, is it the Dadaism ?, am I having a good time? HELL NO FOR THIS LAST ONE ! This is undoubtedly the worst of (Ron Howard) yet, frankly it looked more like it was directed by the twisted Grinch himself ! P.S : my review's title is a phrase has been said by one of the movie's characters, and once I heard it, I found nothing better than it to describe the annoying time that I was having.","

","I am surprised that anyone DID like this film, as there was much I was disappointed with.  The few highlights for me were the costumes / sets, which had some clever ideas, and the twist of a capitalistic / materialistic townspeople who have lost sight of the potential of the holiday.  I thought Cindy Lou Who's acting was disappointing, as was much of the writing, especially the poor additions to Dr. Seuss' original poetry - it was VERY clear to me what was added.  Also, I think the changes to the story didn't serve it well for the most part and were not well thought out.  Carrey as the Grinch didn't have a lot to work with but I think he did the best he could - there were a few moments I couldn't help but laugh.  Overall, I think they chose cheap glitz over substance, a good story, acting or detail like so many Hollywood cookie cutter films.","

Only one simple thread around which you could impute your own world. Trampled on here with all sorts of extra stuff as if our own minds didn't world.It was minimalism in the verse. Some scant remnant of that remains, buried deep in ordinary, vapid dialog.But most of all it was minimalism in the drawings. Those drawings were an anti art nouveau which started clean but ended excessively ornamented. Each line was a joke on itself, a self-referential comment on how the mind likes to take the simplest thing and can't help from elaborating until human limits are reached.His homeopathic style depends on this phenomenon and his simultaneous joke about it. It would require a rather clever and skilled art director to get behind that and realize it for film. What we end up here is `Hook,' except the strutter here is Carrey instead of Williams.The team that did `Casper' might have been able to pull this off. I don't understand why when they spend gobs of money, they don't spend part of it on a designer with vision.","

","I am absolutely appalled and flabbergasted that so many people don't like this film as much as I do, as it has the makings to be not only one of the best live action adaptations, but also one of the best Christmas films out there. It's not perfect, but it sure as hell is better than what some make it out to be. The only issues I can think of is maybe the pacing can be a bit sloppy and the overabundance of fog throughout this film can be a bit distracting in a few scenes, but neither of these really hindered my experience with this film. Jim Carrey is fantastic as the Grinch and everyone else did a pretty good job as well. The humor in this film really does hit and makes this film one of the more sillier Christmas films out there, and that's definitely not a bad thing. The story adaptation is pretty damn spot on with the book, and while that happens during the second half of the second act, I do appreciate that this film doesn't stretch the original story out, and instead, has a new story beforehand setting everything up. It really works well in my opinion and adds a lot to the original story without tainting it. Overall, this film, while it's not quite on par with the original animated classic, is still a staple in the line of Christmas films and I absolutely recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to do so, as it is still a wonderful adaptation.","

","Some things are just not meant to be live action. Dr Seuss must have been rolling in his grave as his second wife sold the film rights of his Christmas hit to Universal Pictures, who then ran with the idea that live action was the way to re-imagine these beloved children's books. They would begin the Dr Seuss cinematic universe and fill their films with big name comedic stars to draw in audiences. They would stretch 30 page picture books into bloated, overstuffed feature length films. They would replace the simple, economical illustrations of the original with grotesque costumes and lurid colour schemes (Bo Welch, the director of The Cat in the Hat, began his career as a production designer in Tim Burton films such as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, and copy and pasted the same eye-popping style into his own film). Gone was the playful bounce of the Seuss rhymes; a dark menace replaces the atmosphere hanging over Whosville as Christmas approaches. The town was once a circle of warmth and generosity, until a Christmas ghoul by the name of Ron Howard came along and turned it into the capital of greed and consumerism. The film takes something well meaning and good hearted and turns it into a garish toyland to serve its extended plot. Given the challenge of forcing a hour plus long conflict from a picture book, the script turns the story on its head - it was actually the Grinch who was the original victim, a case of schoolyard bullying, and the Whos who become the villains. Seeing the makeup of these Whos, it's hard not to agree - they've taken quaint cartoon figures and replaced them with life sized humanoids sporting button noses that make them look like some god-forsaken pig-dog mutation out of a secret government lab. Perhaps Howard realised that such monstrosity could not be the heart of the film; no wonder the most innocent of all the Whos, precocious little six year old Cindy Lou, never has to sit in that makeup chair. Her character must over-correct for all the Who buffoonery with a cloying sweetness that by now has become a holiday cliche. If you didn't hate Christmas like the Grinch does during the opening credits, you just might after a little girl keeps popping up to shove tinsel and mince pie in your face. Creepy as the Whos are, they are no match for the real antagonist of the story, the eponymous green Grinch who lives up in the mountains and is revered as a Christmas legend. The script's attempts to humanise him this time around via flashback only serve to make audiences recoil further; his junior form is propped up on the school chair like a creepy puppet, forced sympathy engineered on strings. His adult self isn't the Grinch. It's Jim Carrey in a green fur suit, with a transatlantic-Connery-esque growl thrown in for good measure. Maybe executives were drawn to the manic energy of a Carrey, of a Myers. They thought they could ride on the screen power of these comic icons and then slap on a Seuss label. Carrey is aggressively twisted, and not in a good way. One could barely stand the sight of him with a pot belly and nothing else (clothing for his bottom half is optional, apparently), gyrating and sashaying all over the place. Seeing him fidget and snarl, seeing him shove those hairy pipe cleaners he calls fingers into his nostrils and crunch beer bottles with his fangs, we can see this isn't the mischievous fiend that Seuss envisioned. This is our drunk uncle in a creepy Halloween costume, belching all the way into December. Getting Carrey allows them a little mileage for a few elongated action sequences, if only to further press the point that everything the Grinch touches turns to disaster (the camera assumes the position of some drunk bird that can't stop tilting its head). It's too bad that most of this action mimics the same juvenile trash that belongs in cheap sitcoms. You know, crotch humour, exaggerated slapstick, Grinch getting catapulted right into a woman's cleavage, or pinning mistletoe on his behind. Most of it is pitched at a juvenile level but actually aimed at adults; kids won't recognise the Chariots of Fire theme, or register any of his extended stand-up monologues (to himself), and when Carrey winks and talks right into the camera it's just another gag (""And this time I'll keep it off.""). They've never seen the Chuck Jones cartoon anyway, for comparison. I'm actually impressed at how atrocious this adaptation is. It takes a great deal of talent and incompetence to turn a cartoon classic into this gaudy, useless trinket. Is there any upside? Well, at least it isn't as bad as The Cat in the Hat.","

","When I heard that Jim Carrey was going to play the Grinch, my curiosity peaked. Unfortunately, curiosity killed the cat. Now if you want to say Jim did a good job, that is one thing. His energy and enthusiasm did not go unnoticed. But to talk about the film is a different story. First off I do not remember the Grinch being so hideously ugly, nor do I remember the Who's being as freakish looking either, but all of that is nothing compared to the idiocy of the plot. The words ""Stupid,"" ""tasteless"", ""unamusing"" and just plain ""gross"" come to mind. Out of all the gags, I only laughed once. I was surprised at the normal ""Jim Carrey"" Adult humor that was placed into a Family film. Fifth graders will love it, most adults will be unamused and little kids might even be afraid of the Grinch's ghastly appearance. This movie takes an original classic story that shows the true meaning of Christmas and trashes it into a commercial and meaningless farce, that almost appears to be mocking the original idea. I don't want to give any examples of what I mean because I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but as far as I am concerned the whole thing spoils itself.","

And, if they'd made it 'dark and Tim Burtonish', it wouldn't have been what it was written for--a Children's Story. (People who have children, want to see a kids movie for kids, not adults--YOU sit up all night, with kids who have been given nightmares by Tim Burton's 'kids movies'....) Remember, Dr. Suess Widow had complete control over what would and wouldn't make the final cut, and she is the one who knew what her husband would have wanted. It wasn't until Jim Carrey met her and 'became the Grinch' that she allowed them the rights to the movie. I was charmed by the movie, and glad I decided to go with the family at the last minute.  I think this will become a classic, and I'd better see Oscar nominations for make-up, costumes, set designs, and possibly Carrey for this movie.....He was the Grinch!","

","the grinch was a wonderful film with intense visuals and great acting...although jim carrey was a little overacting (one reason i never liked him in the first place).  the story strayed from the origional tale, only to establish a back story and make the film a little more interesting for a live action hit.my only real beef with the film is that it was way too long...there were parts that i didn't think were needed and way too much goofiness on the part of the GRINCH.all in all a great film that has put me in the holiday spirit with a lesson that all should learn.  MERRY CHRISTMAS.","

","OK, I went to see this one today, expecting either the greatly fun holiday movie that it was shown to be or the excruciating bomb that all the critics made it out to be. Throughout the first part of the movie, I sat there watching it in boredom and thinking that maybe the critics were right after all. Then, at one point about twenty minutes into it, I just got drawn in. From there, it was a great mechanical sleigh ride up to the very end. Jim Carrey just shone through all those layers of makeup and costume as the Grinch, as did the rest of the cast in those weird little noses of theirs. I know it's not much like the original book or cartoon, both of which are holiday favorites of mine, but I don't tend to judge by that if something is good in its own right. It won't win any Oscars or anything (except possibly for things like makeup and sets), but it was a fun holiday movie. I had a total blast watching it, and I would greatly recommend it for someone who is willing to see this good old dog of a story do some new tricks.","

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***
In the land of Whoville high atop a creepy mountain there lives a furry green guy known as the Grinch. For years Whovillians have pretty much left this strange man alone, leaving him to his own lonely devices. However it wasn't always like that. As a very 'different' looking child the Grinch was constantly tormented and teased by unfeeling fellow classmates, culminating in a particularly cruel incident that takes place during a class Christmas party. Angry and anguished the little guy runs away from school and the town and up a mountain where he takes refuge and has lived ever since in a huge gloomy lair.In the happy-go-lucky land of Whoville there lives Cindy Lou Who, an insightful little girl whom tired of holiday ultra-commercialism, questions the real meaning of Christmas. One fateful day during his annual return to wreck holiday havoc in Whoville, the Grinch meets Cindy, an experience that somehow convinces the youngster that there is much more to this man than he allows folks to see...that somewhere way deep down inside this hairy green body...small as it ultimately is...there exists a heart. Like a good reporter Cindy goes on a quest to learn the origin of the much maligned and feared Grinch. After a few days of interviewing the townspeople she indeed learns of the Grinch's dark unhappy childhood and what drove him to flee the town and hate Christmas altogether. Wanting very much to right a past wrong Cindy nominates the Grinch for a special award, her youthful innocence somehow believing that if the Grinch shows up to accept the honor, the town will embrace the creature and all will be well.From the beginning one is struck by Director Ron Howard's dismal practically colourless look to his expensive holiday film. The movie seems to wallow in browns and reds with the actual cinematography appearing to have been shot through a pair of panty-hose. For me the unconventional 'look' of Grinch works for the movie, giving it an other-worldly 'haunting' feel. The other thing that works for this movie is Jim Carrey. No actor in existance could have pulled this off so well, brilliantly balancing a character filled with hatred and deceit with a lonely embittered soul who spews hilarious sarcasm like a demonic water-hose. Carrey inexplicably takes the character of the incredibly (and understandably) mean Grinch and makes him human and even likeable. And when circumstances  finally makes the green guy's heart 'bigger,' I wasn't the only one in the theater welling up with emotion. This is more than a remake of a classic animated Christmas 'short,' this is a beautifully written and performed brand new Christmas classic, that among it's many other attributes, has the intelligence and dignity to actually make us consider what Christmas is supposed to be about.
Although I never discuss what other critics have to say, I am shocked that so many movie reviewers are bad-mouthing this film, some calling it a mean-spirited movie that will scare little kids. The fact is, many film critics just didn't get Grinch or didn't bother to try, seeing this as just another manic vehicle for Jim Carrey instead of the funny, warm and enormously entertaining film that it really is. For my money this is one of the best movies of the year, with Jim Carrey delivering yet another wonderfully energetic and memorable performance. The score provided by the always reliable James (Braveheart, Titanic, Glory, etc.) Horner is appropriately understated except when it needs to be, then in typical Horner fashion, it practically soars off the soundtrack","

","There are a FEW spoilers in this, not many, and certainly not enough to ruin the movie for ya, but I had to warn so as not to get ""Blacklisted""Anyway... when analyzing this movie, you have to take into account several things... the book is only 200 pages or so long, right?  That doesn't translate into a hollywood movie, verbatum.  So, they added some new situations, and characters, and made it a new story with the old spirit. And that's the point really, isn't it?  The whole point of ""The Grinch"" is that ""maybe Christmas isn't from a store.""  Christmas is about love, and family... not gifts and such.So, okay, Ron Howard, or Jim Carrey, or whoever is responsible for the ""fart jokes"" or ""idiotic humor"" okay, so the concept of some of the jokes weren't appropriate for kids... but were they presented in a way that the kids understand it really?  The scene where Grinch gets the mayor to kiss the dogs butt, that had several levels to it, and the kids took it as ""eww, the man's kissing a dog!!!""  and the adults took it as ""eat my dookie mr. maywho!""  So, some crude humor was used.Anyway, I love the original ""Grinch"", I love Jim Carrey, and little Cindy Lou Who was as adorable as all get out...  and I loved this ""Grinch."" Nobody else could have done the Grinch with more sincerity and understanding as Jim did.  I've never been moved by a man covered in green goo/yak fur/and makeup as I was by Jim as the Grinch.And finally, when I was a kid, I remember what the Grinch did for me.  It made me realize Christmas really was more about giving than it was about recieving.  And it made me realize it was mean to judge someone by how they look.  This movie stretched out to encompass a vast audience, and it hooked me, it hooked my parents, it hooked my grandmother, and it hooked my six year old and four year old cousin.Works for me.Do you know what that movie did for kids in that theater?  This is some of what I noticed.""Mommy, why are they so mean to him?""Somebody crying when the Maywho proposed to the chick, breaking the Grinches heart again.A zillion squeals of laughter compared to only one squeal of horror when they briefly showed termites in the Grinches teeth.Cheers, clapter, smiles and tears as the Grinch presented the presents back to Whoville... by kids, by teens, by adults, and by old fogeys.I don't recall anyone coming out of that theater sulking, mad, or ranting about a ""ruined classic"" or ""that crude Carrey character""... I recall smiles and happy families.And smiles, laughter, and family is what Christmas is all about, when Dr. Suess wrote the book, now, and in BOTH movies, cartoon and real life.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594308/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594308,NA," CU Film Critic takes on ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""
","I've seen far many, many reviews of `Dr. Seuss' How the The Grinch Stole Christmas' in which critics can't resist the urge to write in rhyme, and every last one I've read irritates me.  Yet, as I sit to begin my review, I feel the uncontrollable urge to begin rhyming myself. I promise not to.I remember being excited to hear that there would be a live action version of `The Grinch' starring Jim Carrey, and I also remember being disturbed to hear that it would be directed by Ron `Opie' Howard.  I had hoping for an artistic genius such as Tim Burton or a holiday entertainment luminary like John Hughes.  Oddly, Opie pulled this one off.If you want to see a good, fun holiday movie, go see this one.  I'm not going to start comparing it to the classic animated `Grinch,' but I think it did a noteworthy job of giving some back story on the Grinch's character and a little history on the town of Whoville.It also attempted to answer some age old questions- most notably, `Where is Whoville?'  Well, the movie begins by showing, visually, that Whoville exists deep inside a tiny snowflake.  The only problem with this is that the rest of the film goes on to prove that Whoville is actually located in northern Minnesota.I've noticed that Jim Carrey is a lot more fun to watch when he talks like Jimmy Stweart on crack.  Honestly, I don't think anyone else could have pulled off such a classic character.  Carrey's Grinch could be the standard by which we measure all other bastardized Hollywood versions of cherished childhood memories.`The Grinch' is packed with Ron Howard's `in-jokes' and double entendres aimed at disillusioned Gen-Xers.  Seuss purists may find this distasteful, but honestly, why spend millions of dollars on a big-budget remake if you're just going to rehash the same material?Cindy Lou who had gigantic teeth and gigantic hair.  She also sang a nice little tune.  Let's move on.The film's talent award goes to the dog.  If anyone truly lived up to the persona given them in the original Seuss drawings, it was Max.  Some may argue that Carrey's performance was more admirable.  To those people, I say, `but the dog was cute and had an antler on his head for a good portion of the movie.  Did Jim Carrey even attempt this feat?  I think not.'Let's look at `The Grinch' by the numbers.  The props department provided 1,938 candy canes, 152,000 pounds of crushed marble (used for fake snow), 8,200 christmas tree ornaments, and no less than two million linear feet of styrofoam to build the city of Whoville itself.  Opie got the studio to go all out financially, and it shows.  The sets look like you'd expect Whoville to look.  Great stuff.`The Grinch' gets a `B+.'  It won't by any means replace its predecessor as a holiday classic, but you'll leave the theater feeling like a six-year old.","

","There... I dissed a Ron Howard movie. Usually a Ron Howard film dictates quality and a light-hearted touch. This is just heavy handed and makes this story into something it was never meant to do.This is a story about the spirit of Christmas. In the original story, all the Who's of Whoville are not phased by their loss of decorations, libations and gifts. They come together and through their genuine spirit of love, come together, and it is this that makes the Grinch's heart grow.The movie gives a background to the Grinch... and to boot blames the Whovillians for the Grinch's bad attitude. So wrong and flawed.The character of Cindy Lou Who builds on that and further impunes the citizens of Who-ville. tsk tsk tsk. That is not the innocent of the original story.The narration while interesting completely re-writes a beautiful story...tsk tsk tsk Dr. Seuss was right not to let this story be re-told.The odd thing is that this story could have been abstracted into something altogether different ... much like the re-telling of another Christmas classic... Scrooge.But no... the theme was used and abused and ended up with a sad tale.","

","Ron Howard takes an unusual and much loved Children's Classic and turns it into PG rated forgetable trash. Great makeup and creative props and sets, but the writers couldn't decide whether ""Grinch"" would be a children's Christmas movie or a pandering money-maker. The audience would have been as big without the crude dialogue, ""kiss this, Whoville,"" ""bitchin' ride,"" and a kiss on the wrong end of the Grinch's dog. My eleven year old son though these scenes, as well as the scene with the Grinch's head embedded between the breasts of his childhood love interest, were terrific. I wonder if Ronnie Howard's mother would be proud of her son's crude remake of a charming Christmas Classic.","

","I think that anyone who has even just a shred of common sense would see that making a live action AND feature length version of Dr. Seuss' ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" is asking for trouble. To begin with, just look at how this movie looks visually. Now, they could have managed to pull off the visual look - the movie ""The 5000 Fingers Of Dr. T"" managed to have live action Seuss-like visuals that worked. But in THIS movie, it looks horrible. It looks artificial, way overproduced, and to make matters worse the green and pink lighting makes it look even uglier than it was originally.Maybe if they had made this a 100% computer animated movie, they could have pulled off the visual look... but there would still be a bunch of problems, mainly with the script. The Whos, except for Cindy Lou, are a bunch of cold-hearted ugly-looking creeps - you'll actually wish that the Grinch succeed in his plans to ruin their Christmas. The story moves at a snail's pace, due to the writers feeling they had to put in a lot of back story. Further evidence of the writers' desperation is that they take several elements of the 1960s Chuck Jones' version of the tale and replicate them here.Carey tries - he is pretty enthusiastic in his performance - but even he becomes quickly exhausting to witness. But he's not to blame here - blame the director and the writers for shoving him and the rest of the movie down our throats.","

","Yes, Jim Carey is fairly brilliant in what he does and how he does it. However, this is not the ""Jim Carey Show"", it's supposed to be about the Grinch, how he attempted to ruin Christmas and how in the end he finds redemption and all with appropriate humor applied. Not so here. This is, apparently, about Jim Carey, by Jim Carey, and nothing else but Jim Carey. Hence why for the last few years he hasn't been involved with anything noteworthy. People get very tired of someone who's ALWAYS ""on"". Same thing happened to Robin Williams. You may be the star of the picture but you are not the picture itself, or you shouldn't be. You are merely the performer hired to perform the material handed to you. The 1966 TV animated version is much better because of three things: the animation of Chuck Jones based upon Dr. Suess's characters, the adherence to the actual story and of course the profound narration by Boris Karloff. Watch this latest ""grinch"" along with Carey's Andy Kaufamnn ""tripe"" if you dare.","

","Director Ron Howard usually makes wonderful films; 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', and I even liked 'Willow'. But he seems to have taken an off day for the big-budget Dr. Seuss adaptation 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. 'Grinch' is a mess, drowned in special effects and gaudy production design, and it completely misses the point of the original story.Howard does something here I would never have thought possible: He makes Jim Carrey unfunny. I am not kidding. Carrey is just NOT FUNNY. Oh, he gives it his all, milking every joke 'til it's dry, but his performance, I am unhappy to report, falls flat. It's truly depressing to see a great comic actor in a spectacularly bad role.The overcompensating script by 'Roger Rabbit' authors Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman doesn't help matters. It tries to 'explain' the Grinch's antisocial behavior. I admire the effort, but that's just not a good idea. The movie does have one good thing in it: Taylor Momsen, who steals the show as Cindy Lou Who. Momsen is the only actor in the movie who understands what she's doing.Howard piles on the sap in the final act, and I groaned more than once during those last 10 minutes. Ron Howard: What happened, man? 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' is a disaster.","

","What was Dr. Seuss' widow thinking??? Entrusting Ron Howard to make a movie of this most special of stories???!!!!  The first hour sapped any Christmas spirit I had and I had to leave.  Charmless, bland design, bad songs, inappropriate humor.  Yuck!  (I don't blame Jim Carrey...in fact I'm a pretty big fan)  This movie was made without any love and that's too bad. That it will become one of the biggest grossing films of all time is truly depressing as it goes to prove that in some cases the actual movie doesn't even matter, as long as the marketing campaign is shrewd and well financed. Sigh.","

","`Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas'  (2000) *Out of **** This is a movie that everyone wanted to see and they left wishing they hadn't.  I used to be a Jim Carry fan but after a while he is just another irritating, overpaid actor.  The main character in this film is, without a doubt, Jim Carry, who we all thought would be perfect for the part.  He is a lot less than perfect.  He put so much craziness in the Grinch that he killed the character.  It wouldn't have been so bad if the whole movie didn't revolve around him but when the main character is in every scene and the actor kills the character, there is nothing left. When this happens you look to the director but then when you realize that the director is Ron Howard you know you are severely in trouble.  He just is not enough to save a film and there were no supporting actors good enough to help him. How can you call this film `Dr Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas' when that plot doesn't start until an hour into the show? In the first hour they attempt to give a little background on the story but it doesn't help the viewer learn anything.  Then at one point in the middle of the film the plot is solved when everyone loves the grinch.  He then is reminded of his childhood trauma and again turns into the grinch, why not end it there? Instead they take it to another level.  This, finally is Dr. Suess' version. The part that I don't understand is that it didn't fit with the first part. The movie could have been a lot better if the would have just left it with Dr. Suess, but instead Ron Howard made his version and then used Dr. Suess. It can't work and it didn't.  If you are one of the few who didn't see it and you are under 5 or over 80 go see it; otherwise I don't recommend it.","

","Let me say that making this movie was an abomination to the meaning of the story, and, unless the quality was good enough to overcome such feelings, the people behind this project have their hearts two sizes two small.I hated this movie.  As much as I love Carrey (his one bad movie is Ace 2), this movie should have reigned him in just a little, and yet used his talents.  But, alas, Ron Howard couldn't say ""no"" to a superstar.  The movie then had the difficult job of stretching the small book into a feature length movie.  This is difficult, but it could have been done, maybe in musical style or some other way.The movie seemed to want to become a musical, but it didn't.  It had the ""i want to be a hit single,"" sung by Cindy Lou Who ""Where Are You Christmas?"" While I really liked the song, it was unnecessary, demeaning, commercialized, and insulting to my intelligence.  I think that the song should have been the intro to a musical version of The Grinch or something.Another thing that is bad is the whole new plots.  The actual book really doesn't start for an hour.  They spend almost an hour on WHOLE NEW MATERIAL. Once the actual story comes into play from the book, the movie is actually quite good, but before then, bleh.  First, they make the Whos greedy.  The Whos were never greedy.  They had lots of material items because they could, but they never embellished their happiness on them.  Their happiness came from their heart and from the Spirit of Christmas, not from anything else. Next, they gave The Grinch a traumatizing childhood.  I don't know if this was added as a response to the Columbine shootings, or if they just were trying to attract more groups, but it DIDN'T WORK.So, the movie's first hour sucked.  The movie also lasted too long.  It was TWENTY MINUTES LONGER than South Park.  It had less plot or storylines to keep it moving, and it dragged its feet and plodded along.  There was so much that could have been cut out, the childhood memories, the unnecessary chorus-leader thingy, etc.  CUT IT DOWN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY PEOPLE.THE GOOD NEWS:  Ok, I guess that I liked Carrey acting like Carrey, to a point.  It just would have been so much more endearing in a different movie. The styles were fantastic, along with the devilishly cool camera-work. The whole movie is almost over stylized, but so were Dr. Seuss' books.  If anything, go see it for the sets, the angles, the hairstyles, the clothes, Carrey's make-up, etc.  Its the only reason to go to this waste of celluloid.2/10","

","I can tell from reading these reviews that some people liked this movie. I have no idea why.  I don't mean to seem Grinchy.  I wanted to like it.  I liked the original.  I like Jim Carrey movies.  I could see children liking it, but there were so many inappropriate parts for young children (of course most parents these days don't seem to mind).  I haven't seen a movie I thought was this bad since Yor-Hunter From the Future.First, what made the original so successful was the rhyming in the background.  That is why the last half hour was tolerable because the narrator is reading the story and we are watching the action that goes along with it.  Without that, the story is just boring and it is for the first hour.Second, the original was pure.  It was a simple story about Christmas and the Christmas spirit.  In this they threw in a love triangle and a shaving incident gone bad that simply confused everything.  It was almost as if they were simply passing time.Third, the flash back scenes made no sense.  The Grinch was never a nice person, yet somehow they threw in other scenes that made it seem like the Mayor and his unrequited love were the reasons for his Grinchiness.I could go on, but I won't.  Like I said, some people liked it, so I wouldn't avoid seeing it just because I said so.  However, you can't say I didn't warn you.","

","BEWARE OF BOGUS REVIEWS. SOME REVIEWERS HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW TO THEIR NAME. NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST ABOUT THESE FILMS.The beloved book and animated special gets turned into a a mega budget movie directed by Ron Howard starring Jim Carrey. In this feature length film we get to see why ""The Grinch"" became ""the Grinch"". The film is packed with the right amount of laughs and heart. All the Whos down in Whoville enjoy celebrating Christmas with much happiness and joy, except the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who hatefully resents Christmas and the Whos with great wrath and occasionally pulls dangerous and harmful practical jokes on them. As a result, no one likes or cares for him. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou (Taylor Momsen) believes everyone is missing the point about Christmas by being more concerned about the gifts and festivities. After her two brothers are harassed by the Grinch when they trespass on his domain, and she herself has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the Post office, in which he saves her life, Cindy Lou becomes interested in his history; she asks everyone what they know about him, and soon discovers that he has a tragic past.The Grinch actually arrived in Whoville by mistake when he was a baby, and was adopted by two elderly sisters. Although he showed some sadistic tendencies as a child, he was rather timid and not the cruel, selfish person he would become. He was bullied by his classmates (particularly by Augustus May Who (Jeffrey Tambor), who grew up to be Mayor of Whoville) because of his appearance, with the exception of Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski), who was courted by both the Grinch and May Who. One Christmas season when he was eight, the Grinch made a gift for Martha, but attempted to shave his face after being made fun of for having a ""beard"", cutting himself by accident. When his classmates saw his face covered with shaving tape the next morning, they ridiculed him yet again. He lost his temper, went on a rampage and ran away to live on a mountain to the north of Whoville, Mount Crumpit.The one scene that should of been cut is when the child sings ""Where are you Christmas?"". It stops the film. The song should of been sung over the closing credits.","

","A big part of me hates this movie. It's overblown, the simplicity of the original story is smashed, and the look of the film is garish. They turned the Whos into smug materialists instead of the kind-hearted, wise folks who loved Christmas because it was a time of love and fellowship. Also, no one can replace Boris Karloff as the Grinch. Ever.Still, I cannot deny this film is a major guilty pleasure for me. Jim Carrey is over-the-top and ridiculous, but his overplaying makes me laugh (and I must admit, the make-up on him is fantastic). The disgusting-looking Whos are so terrible-looking, but that's hilarious too. Everything they could have got wrong went wrong, but it's done in such a stupid manner that it makes it kind of charming in a weird, surreal way.I wouldn't recommend it, but at the same time, if you want to do some MST3K for a holiday movie and got tired of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, then this is the flick for you.","

","I've been a fan of the book and the cartoon for a long time, since I was a kid back in the States. At first I was skeptical about a movie conversion of this Dr. Seuss masterpiece, because I didn't think it would make the cut, it would be a turkey, or in this case a roast beast. But as I watched it, it turned out great! Jim Carey never stops making me laugh, and with a few emotional scenes. The man is back with green once again, but there were some scenes that didn't look like it was faithful to the book, there was more background to the Grinch's character, but I can forgive them for that, this was also touching as the cartoon was. Especially when the Grinch finally had a big heart, it made me feel all warm inside, Jim Carey was a perfect Grinch. Perfect for the holidays. I recommend this to everyone to kids from 1-92, it should be shown during Christmas, so you can all have a green Christmas. And the soundtracks were also great and wonderful. Forget the Cat In The Hat, watch this and have a Green Christmas! Thank you Dr. Seuss, this film proves that your legacy lives on!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594370/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594370,3," How ""The Grinch"" was desecrated: Carrey is buried in depressing remake
","The 1966 cartoon special ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas,"" co-directed by recently deceased animation pioneer Chuck Jones, has stood the test of time for over thirty years. It's a freewheeling masterpiece about the eponymous yuletide-hating green monster (voiced flawlessly by Boris Karloff), who is so mean and grouchy and so lovable at the same time. He had no complicated reason for his disposition, and there were no forced morals woven into the plot. Sure, he changed his ways in the end, but it wasn't shoved in our faces. It was, and still is, just plain fun. And who didn't sympathize with his loyal yet long-suffering dog, Max? On the flipside, this inevitable live version, directed by Ron Howard, does one hell of a disservice to Dr. Seuss's story. Where do we begin? The weak, preachy script reeks of modern-day political correctness. The sets are poorly designed and claustrophobic. The supporting characters are meaningless. There's even a (gasp!) love interest. And yes, there is dialogue about how Christmas ""doesn't come from a store."" (Meanwhile, the movie opens to all of Whoville in the midst of a collective shopping spree. Hmm.) The convoluted screenplay was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, who both penned the still-unrivaled ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit.""Here, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) is a maligned and misunderstood recluse. The film explains his nasty nature in a very unpleasant and utterly pointless flashback scene, in which he throws a temper tantrum as he is teased by his classmates. The role of Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, in her film debut) is expanded simply because there has to be the obligatory lone character who sees good in the crabby Grinch. Speaking of seeing, some cartoons were not meant to be seen as live versions (this spelled the downfall of the two ""Flintstones"" films). With all due respect to Carrey's painstaking effort, which included three-hour sessions in the makeup chair, that company definitely includes the Grinch. Think what a live movie starring Bugs Bunny would look like, then immediately clear that sacrilegious thought from your mind.The movie is three times longer than the cartoon, and it resulted in a lot of excess baggage, particularly Carrey's overbearing yet familiar slapstick routine, which was used in order to fill screen time and perhaps take the audience's attention away from the script deficiencies. Despite having a Golden Globe Award to his name, Carrey's film career is in danger of being remembered solely for such minutiae instead of his otherwise solid acting.
By now, you may have already surmised that I'm in favor of the animated classic. (On a side note, I saw the trailers for ""Grinch"" while watching another animated classic, ""Chicken Run."") There's no gentle way to say it: this celluloid defecation is an insult to Dr. Seuss. I don't think I have to elaborate any further on that. Never mind the plot, the characters and the depressing atmosphere of Whoville; what viewers will find to be the most traumatizing scene in the entire film is seeing the Grinch in lederhosen. 3/10","

","People seem to either love this movie or hate it.  I am in the latter group, because I love the story by Dr. Seuss and I cannot understand what Ron Howard has done to it.  In the original story, and in the cartoon that faithfully followed, almost no time goes by before the Grinch is cutting out his Santa outfit and trying to steal Christmas.  But in the film, quite a bit of new story is told before we start seeing ""How"" the Grinch stole Christmas, so much so that the film might be renamed ""Why,"" not ""How.""  And it isn't even a very compelling tale.  First, the Grinch moved to a mountain garbage dump because he was essentially driven away as a child by Whoville's mean-spirited youth.  Then, when he was invited to return, he was driven back to the mountain by Whoville's mean-spirited Mayor.  Where does all this come from?  Maybe the film's title should also recognize that there are in fact several Grinches in Whoville now.I much prefer Dr. Seuss's simple explanation, that the Grinch was mean because his shoes were too tight and his heart was too small.  After all, the story is not really supposed to be about the life and times of the Grinch but about the spirit of Christmas that overpowers even one as mean as the Grinch, a spirit so purely demonstrated, with and without the trimmings, by all the Whos in Whoville.The Whos in this film are not so pure: they drink booze, they envy their neighbor's Christmas lights, and they do say ""Boo-hoo"" on the morning after, at least momentarily, while the book's Whos are not even detracted from their singing.But maybe I am just ""bitchin',"" as Carrey's Grinch said when he slid face first into a Who girl's supple bosom.  Merry Christmas, indeed!","

","Ron Howard's take on The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is a thoroughly uneven, much too dark, and often violent film that stumbles a fine line between cartoonish children's film and dark, adult comedy.Plot synopsis is unnecessary, because the story is extremely well known and the title says it all: a Grinch steals Christmas, only in true Hollywood fashion, the tale is trumped up with millions of dollars in special effects and elaborate production design, adding nothing to the story.  As the Grinch, Jim Carrey gives it his best, but he is hampered by unfunny lines and Ron Howard's stiff direction.The first half hour of the film lacks any magic or laughs; Howard doesn't seem to know how to unfold the story and instead relies on the twisted scenery and often grotesque makeup of Whoville and the Who's to give a sense of an imaginative film.  The set design seems more nightmarish than cartoonish however, and could easily have been pulled out of a Tim Burton film: curved, dark, twisted, and sparsely lit.  It just does not fit. Equally out of place are scenes of the Grinch chewing glass, popping a red hot screw in his mouth, and engaging in drunken driving.  At one point I was expecting to see Carrey actually murder one of the Whos in a blood bath.Then there's the little girl who portrays Cindy Lou Who, Taylor Momsen.  She delivers her lines as if she's acting in a school play: example: *in whiny voice* ""But Christmas is blah blah...blah blah blah...*  Haley Joel Osment she ain't.  SNL's Shannon and the always sharp and fabulous Baranksi are both wasted as two women who appear to be engaged in a bitter rivalry. After their first scene together, however, this apparent subplot goes nowhere.The Grinch is mired in scenes of grotesqueness and a truly nightmarish set design.  Ron Howard's inept handling of the classic Seuss tale can't even be saved by a tremendously make-upped Jim Carrey.  There are few inspired laughs, special effects to cover up the gaping holes in its pacing, and two very forgettable songs written probably to push the CD soundtrack.

","Jim Carrey is very funny, but this movie was a complete failure to me. It was just a bizarre, poorly-written kiddie movie, which are among the worst kinds of movies. I'm surprise it did as well as it did. I thought it was pretty bad. There were almost no funny jokes, the Grinch was way too bizarre (the kid version of him was too sadistic also), and when those elements weren't being presented, it was filled with corniness often found in bad kiddie movies. The way the Grinch was written was what ruined the whole movie for me. He was just too bizarre and too sadistic. I'm sure Jim Carrey did what he could with it, but ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is one story that shouldn't have been made into a full-length, non-animated movie. I thought it should've stayed an animated, 1950s TV movie. This was an attempt at ""improving"" a beloved tale that failed miserably. No one should have to watch this bad flick.","

","In the hands of director Ron Howard and star Jim Carrey, ""Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", is a loud, obnoxious, excessive, CHARMLESS bore. This very short story is expanded to 1 hour and 45 minutes of grotesque imagery that focuses on repugnant characters, who wear out their welcome within 30 seconds.

","Of course a ""Grinch"" movie is going to make money with big names like Jim Carey and Ron Howard...At 104minutes long, the movie should have been 90minutes long. There was easily 14 minutes of pure GARBAGE. Jim Carey could have done such a splendid job of playing the Grinch; however, it seems obvious that Ron Howard allowed Mr. Carey to do his thing - unfortunately, it was severely over done! While I couldn't think of anyone more perfect to play the Grinch, someone needed to put a leash on Carey as he drastically overplayed and ruined this movie. It's unfortunate, the movie could've been so much more... with LESS! I just watched this movie for the first time in 10yrs with my little girls, and I hated it!","

","Why? Why was this made? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, necessarily, just pointless, which is almost as, well, bad. Amazing how all this money was spent and the final product doesn't even come close to either the 10-page story (or however many pages it was) and the 1/2 hour-long 1966 cartoon.Visually, this live-action Grinch is perhaps the best rendition (the Grinch himself, that is; the live-action Whos look ridiculous), but that's about all this movie has over the other two. Compare the flawless narration of Boris Karloff to the lackluster narration of Sir Anthony Hopkins (who sounds as if he'd rather be doing anything else; I got the strong sense that he was bored to tears doing this) and you can't help but wonder what's the point. Compare Thurl Ravenscroft's rendition of ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" to Carrey's spastic rendition and you'll want to sew Jim Carrey's lips shut.Finally, compare the pacing. This story didn't need to be more than a few pages or half an hour long. Yet, somehow, this film is 104 minutes! 80 minutes, I can perhaps understand, but 104? Why, for example, the protracted role of Cindy Lou Who? Not enough justification to make a movie, I'm sorry to say. At one point when she asks Grinch-Santa what Christmas is about and he tells her toys, she answers ""that's what I was afraid of.""Excuse me while I gag myself with a fork.""Unnecessary"" is all I can think of to say.","

","Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman Michael Caine), but this one needs to be filed under ""Films that should never have been made."" This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special. This is 2 hours you can never, ever get back.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3146961/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw3146961,6," Don't be a Grinch! This live-action adaptation of the beloved children's tale by Dr. Seuss, wasn't that bad.
","I can understand, why certain people might dislike this film. I agree that the live-action film didn't really needed to be made, and that the film will never outdo the original 1966's TV animation movie. Still, this movie directed by Ron Howard is not as bad, as people make it, out to be. Its way better than other live action Dr. Seuss adaptations like 2003's Cat in the Hat. Produce by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, based on the 1957 story of the same name by author, Dr. Seuss, the movie tells the story of the reclusive Mr. Grinch (Jim Carrey), who decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville by stealing all their gifts and everything holiday related. The only person that can warm his heart is the endearing Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) whom hopes to show the Grinch, the true meaning of Christmas. Because the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions had to be made to the storyline to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the titular character. Most of that backstory is pretty damn good, despite that the fact that it doesn't fit that well to the original story. Things get very confusing as Cindy Lou can't tell the different between Santa Claus's voice and that of the Grinch!?! How is that possible? I found it funny that the Grinch show his face to her, and she still can't tell them, apart. Is she really that clueless!? Another clueless person is the Narrator (Voiced by Anthony Hopkins). The Narrator speaks as if, he had no knowledge, why the Grinch is mean. It doesn't make sense. Did he not see that the Grinch was mock? Anyways, I still like the backstory. Remind me of the outcast revenge horror movies, just in a tamer kid movie. Sure, it make the citizen of Whoville look like materialism consumer jerks, but the Whos in the novel, didn't have much of a personality. It even gives us, more reason to feel for the Grinch. It made him more sympathetic, than pure unlikeable. The movie expands on the Grinch's character, actually creating legitimate motivation for his actions and a reason why he stole Christmas this year as opposed to any previous year, in comparison to the original story where he simply hated Christmas and randomly decided that after years of putting up with it, he would ruin it. I think this backstory, really gave the movie more emotional depth. Did it weakened the overall moral plot to an extent? Kinda, but it was really needed. Most audience members that saw this movie, had already readt the book in the past. So, most of them, knew coming in, what's going to happen. I think by adding depth, it made the movie a little less predictable and little more watchable. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have a lot of pointless filler scenes that run the time, a little too long. Most of the jokes in the film are pretty clever, and had lot of wit to it. Lots of pop culture references, wisecracks and insults, break the fourth wall humor, slapstick, gross potty humor, and wordplay and puns are some of the jokes, you'll see in this. Lots of adult jokes like sexual, ethic, dirty jokes, are mixed so well with childish humor under a PG rating. It's has everything for everybody, but it really depend on the parents, if they will allow their children to watch this film or not. Not everything is kid's friendly as there are frightens imagery. Most of the jokes for me, personal, hit the funny bone hard. I couldn't stop, laughing at how funny Jim Carrey makes it out to be. A lot of people might criticizing Jim Carrey's performance as obnoxious over the top. I find it, alright. After all, it's Jim Carrey. He's known for over the top, wacky performances before, where critics love him. I don't know what makes this role, any differ than Ace Ventura or Lloyd Christmas. I guess, certain people want the Grinch to be a one-dimensional Scrooge, rather a full-fresh out character. I also found the young actress, Taylor Momsen to be very good at her age. While, she didn't have the chops for a singing voice, she did carry the heart & soul of the film with her performance. Most of the music in the film was pretty amazing to listen to. James Horner' score get you into the mood for the holiday. Faith Hill's song 'Where Are You Christmas?' awaken that Christmas spirit within you. Jim Carrey's 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch' isn't as good, as the original as he tend to overdo it with multiply voices, and volume tones, but it's funny as hell. Even some of early 2000's Boys Bands feature in the soundtrack wasn't as bad, as I thought, they were going to be. I still have mixed feelings about the production. The cinematography need a little more cleaned up. The sets are very beautiful, but you can't see it with all the mist and fog. I know, Ron Howard was really going for the winter type of weather, here, to make it look more surreal, but it's really distracting. Some shots like the CGI wide shot are really made well on the computer, but most of the footage film on the set, looks like it was film in a steam bath with a lot of muted gloomy colors. It doesn't mixed. The film won the Best Make Up award at the Oscars that year, but I didn't really think it was that good. It wasn't ground-breaking. I saw Jim Carrey in similar make up in 1988's Earth Girls are Easy. He look almost the same, but green, instead of red fur. Overall: I love this movie and watch it over and over every Christmas despite its faults. It's a must watch.","

","This is a live-action adaptation of the Dr. Seuss novella, following the classic 1966 animated short by Chuck Jones (narrated by horror icon Boris Karloff); for the record, I own a copy of both the latter and the earlier Stanley Kramer production of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T (1953) in my collection. This remake, on the other hand, features the voice of a bored-sounding Anthony Hopkins. The Grinch (actually the title of the copy I watched, shown on local TV) is an ideal role for the facial contortions and over-the-top antics of Jim Carrey. He is a hairy creature in the fictional town of Whoville (whose 'normal' inhabitants are elfish in appearance).They love Christmas and celebrate it in grand fashion, but The Grinch does not since he had always been given the cold shoulder at this time of year in view of his unusual appearance. Consequently, he has gone to live by himself in the mountains (attacking occasional trespassers from town) but a little girl feels pity on The Grinch and determines to help him (even carrying out a survey around town to learn what the townsfolk really think of him!). When a prize for the most prominent personality is to be handed out, she nominates The Grinch, even if the Mayor (the latter's arch-enemy and contender for the hand of the town belle) expects it to be given to himself. The girl convinces The Grinch to accept but, when the ceremony turns unpleasant – with the people of Whoville making fun of him a' la The Hunchback Of Notre Dame – he decides to take revenge by disrupting their Christmas festivities (the premise, then, is very similar to the recently-viewed THE Christmas THAT ALMOST WASN'T {1966})!What he does is wear the traditional Santa Claus clothing and, rather than delivering presents as he is supposed to, The Grinch goes round the Whoville houses on Christmas Eve to steal the gifts ready to be opened the next day! However, his triumph is short-lived as the townsfolk realize – once again, thanks to the girl – that Christmas is essentially a time of solidarity but, of course, this being at heart a morality play, The Grinch is himself reformed and finally accepted into the town's fold. Though reasonably engaging (the little girl's sincere portrayal helps a lot in this regard), occasionally funny (for instance, The Grinch dresses his dog like a reindeer on his nefarious expedition!) and undeniably good to look at (highlighted by the imaginative production design of the Whoville locale), this still makes for little more than a kiddie movie. Incidentally, Carrey would later 'star' in that other Yuletide favorite A Christmas CAROL (2009), which I also included in my schedule for this season.","

","I already loved ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" when it was released and I'm still loving it now, 5 years later. Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out.Sure, the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All of the sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way, without ever becoming truly ridicules. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a campy movie making at its very best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie.Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also received an Academy Award. Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch.The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me. Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here, as in the United States or England. For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.The musical score by James Horner is good and fun, even though it's your average every day Horner stuff, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work.Perfect Christmas entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","

Young Cindy-Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, cute but cringeworthy) is eager to find out why the Grinch is so hateful of Christmas, and tries to tell him that Christmas is not so bad. With a few bits of poetry by Anthony Hopkins, the narrator of the tale. I expected far better than this and while some parts raise a smile, especially when it's Carrey provoking them, it's still easily forgotten the morning after.

","""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is such a great and heartwarming story! Jim Carrey gives an amazing performance as the Grinch. He is so funny and brings so much joy to every moment that he is on the screen. How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a story about a Grinch who never really fit in with his town and because of that he lives apart from all of the Whos down in Whoville. One Christmas he meets a Who named Cindy Lou Who. Cindy invites the Grinch to come down off of his mountain and join the rest of the Whos at their big Christmas celebration. While at the celebration the mayor of Whoville gives the Grinch a present that reminds him that he is not really apart of Whoville and that he is an outsider. The Grinch is outraged and decides to steal christmas from the Whos. With help from Max, his dog, Grinch's steals everything that is reminiscent of Christmas from Whoville. He takes the tree, food, ornaments, decorations, presents, etc. so that Whoville won't be able to celebrate Christmas. Much to his dismay, the Whos manage to celebrate Christmas without the presents and decorations by remembering that the most important thing about Christmas is who you are with and not what you have. Cindy Lou Who goes up the mountain to invite the Grinch to celebrate Christmas with her. While she is there, she is nearly crushed by the sleigh that the Grinch used to steal all of Christmas. The Grinch saves her and together they go back down the mountain. The Grinch apologizes for stealing Christmas and is forgiven for stealing Christmas. He then spends the rest of Christmas with the Whos.","

Jim is also a wonderful Grinch but many the film suffers from a lack of diversity. With a town that is a full of Christmas lights there is hardly any color pallet o the town! It all blends.

","Released in early 2000, Ron Howard's live-action version of Dr. Seuss' ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" stars Jim Carrey in the eponymous role of a green curmudgeonly monster living on a mountain outside of Whoville. He hates Christmas and has a beef with some of the citizens of the village, like the mayor (Jeffrey Tambor), but little Mary Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) inspires change in his life and the town. Christine Baranski is on hand as a woman in Whoville who has a secret crush on the mean freak.The original 1966 cartoon based on the 1957 book was/is a potent denouncement of the materialistic side of Christmas: After the Grinch steals all the presents, food and decorations in Whoville, he's dumbfounded to discover that it doesn't matter to the villagers as they sing together in jubilation to celebrate the holiday, which profoundly transforms the Grinch.This live-action version severely complicates matters in order to extend the runtime to 3½ times as long. Here, the townspeople are not so one-dimensionally benevolent and we discover why the Grinch is so cantankerous & hateful. Concerning the former, the villagers have to learn a lesson about the meaning of Christmas as well as the green meanie. The theme of 'love conquers all' is driven home with Taylor Momsen standing out as the cute 6 year-old girl. Her performance is so great it's hard to believe that she was only 6 during filming. Interestingly, Taylor went on to launch the hard rock band The Pretty Reckless in 2009.The imaginative Dr. Seuss-inspired sets are as good as could be expected for a live-action version of a cartoon and the beefing-up of the story is interesting while turning off purists, but it's Carrey's over-the-top performance that's most memorable, not to mention quotable. The likable dog, Max, is great as well.The film runs 104 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, University City, California, with some outside photography of Utah.GRADE: B","

","My one line summary says it all, but I will be more specific.The scenes involving the Grinch and little Cindy Lou Who are imaginative, zany, and even touching. Jim Carrey pulls out all the stops and goes almost as crazy as he did in THE MASK. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou is the only likeable Who in town. Without these two, the film would be nothing but overly elaborate props, costumes, and sets that completely lose the simplicity of the original book's artwork and the madcap Bugs Bunny qualities of the classic 1966 Chuck Jones cartoon.Minus Boris Karloff's voice and loaded with lots of extra verses that even the Grinch himself detests, the film's whimsey gives way to the clutter and darkness of a Tim Burton flick, but without Burton's dark wit.I think that most people will enjoy parts of the film, especially Jim Carrey's scenes, but I don't see this becoming the classic that the 1966 cartoon is.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594425/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594425,6," Carrey's Makeup the Real Star
","WARNING: These comments may reveal portions of the film plot.The big screen version of ""The Grinch"" works best when it sticks to the original story. While Ron Howard hasn't created a ""great"" film, it is still good, and most people will enjoy this diversion.STORY/SCRIPT: Howard had to build on the original 25 minute cartoon, so many things have been added to the original story you probably remember from your childhood. This isn't bad, since you learn much about what made the grinch, ""the Grinch."" But it also makes for a more sinister character -- one that eats glass, for example.SETS/SPECIAL EFFECTS: Wow!!! Whoville lives! You'll see the color combinations, the animated effects, all brought effectively to life. And everything is seamless enough that you'll probably find yourself forgetting it is special effects. This is one very effective part of the film.MUSIC/SOUNDTRACK: Great fun. Especially effective is when the movie breaks into the classic, ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch..."" You'll want to sing along. But all the music is fun. Could the little girl have been dubbed? Sure, but why? Little kids are cute, and that includes their very off key singing, and I think that is what Howard was going for here. I thought it was fun.MAKEUP/COSTUMES: Here is where the movie excels. Carrey BECOMES the Grich. Not just a live version, but the actual cartoon version. When he smiles, it goes from ear-to-ear, just as in the animated version. And it works both as a sinister smile and a friendly smile. And the residents of Whoville likewise are impressive. Everyone builds on the characters in the book, makes them look real, yet lets the actors skills come through.ACTING/DIRECTING: Carrey is the best here. I found myself thinking of the Grinch, not Jim Carrey as ""The Grinch."" He shines through all those layers of makeup. The poor part is that the Grinch is either really bad or really good, and in the film becomes downright sinister. Result: he doesn't have many levels to play, so he doesn't. It's a bit flat as a result. Likewise, the rest of Whoville. The characters there don't quite make it either.PARENTAL WARNING: Parents, remember that this film is a bit meaner than the cartoon. This includes the acting, the story, and the directing. The littlest kids may be bothered by some of this.OVERALL: This isn't a classic, but it's not as bad as many have said. As one who went to see it to remember the cartoon, I found I should have stuck to the cartoon. That's okay. You'll probably have fun, you just won't need to go back to the film over and over.","

","I guess this movie is OK if you forget about the original and just go with the new one as if it were not a remake. My kids seemed to enjoy it but I just didn't. I tried to like the Grinch but it just didn't make any sense. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** They try to explain why he hates Christmas but even before anything malicious or cruel happens to him, we see him as an infant, bumping another infant out of the way, Then, as a baby, devouring a Santa plate with relish, then again as a small child drawing terrible things happening to Santa (which would of course, ruin Christmas for everyone) while he chuckles with glee to himself. In the book and cartoon, the motivation for why he acted and behaved deviously was never introduced so we never questioned it. But since this movie introduces the motivation, at least they could be consistent in the answer. But all they succeed in doing is showing him acting like a Grinch before he even becomes ""The Grinch"". When his heart grows, the Grinch goes into ridiculous contorted fits of pain and anguish, having the effect of ruining what could and should have been the most touching part of the entire film. At the end, when the townspeople finally accept him, he is still mugging and leering and just being a nuisance. ***END SPOILERS*** In the cartoon and the book (I know, I'm comparing...and that's where this movie comes up short), we end up liking the Grinch and accepting him. There is no motivation in this movie for anything like that and when we see others show affection for him, e.g., Cindy and Martha, there really is no explanation as to why...it's just in the script I guess. Come to think of it, the only people in the movie that I cared for at all were Cindy and the dog Max. Aren't there any likable people in Whoville? They look scary and act kind of mean.The set design was great though, although I found all the make-up distracting and I actually think it would have been better without all the makeup, even for the Grinch character. Jim Carrey has proved that he can do facial contortions, and the audience has the ability to use their imaginations, I think all those layers of makeup were just too much. Give some credit to the audience, we have imaginations too and we would most likely fill in wherever the overdone special effects were lacking but there was no need to do so. No need for imagination at all...everything was done already, whether we liked it that way or not. It could have been a great film, and maybe it is for some people, but I'm not one for all the glitz. Some humanity for the Grinch, especially at the ending would have been nice.","

","Alright, I've seen the 1966 cartoon over 100 times most likely... and I must admit, the more I watch it, the more I wish the cartoon was longer.  Well, this year I got my wish.  I will admit, that it isn't the easiest thing turning a short story into a two hour long movie, but Ron Howard pulled it off.  Yes, I do agree that Tim Burton should have been the one to direct the movie, but I still think that no one else but Jim Carrey could have pulled off the character of the Grinch.Carrey does lots of goofy things in this movie that you wouldn't have previously thought that the Grinch would do, but I think that if Carrey had made the character a little less goofy and a little more serious at the beginning of the movie, then maybe it would work.  Because the Grinch's character is supposed to just be miserable and grumpy, then when he's stealing the christmas presents, he could act a little more goofy because he's ""enjoying"" what he's doing.Either way, it's not Carrey's fault.  He does a flawless performance (as always) and can pull off an awesome grinchy smile.  Tim Burton would have caused the film to be darker and aimed more towards the adults.  This may have made the movie a little better (or worse, hey.. we can't prove Tim Burton could do it better) but that defeats the entire purpose of this film.It is not intended entirely for adults.  Yes, it was written so that it interests the adults as well.. but it was created for the kiddos.The beautiful world that Ron Howard created works perfectly though.  I loved Mt. Crumpet and Who-ville.  Who-ville is a town where straight lines don't exist, everything has to curve and bend (just like Seuss had always inteded) and that must have been quite a challenge for any director.  But he does pull it off nicely.The backstory on the Grinch (that explains why he hates Christmas) defeats the line in the poem ""The Grinch hated Christmas, he hated the whole season. Please don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason.""  But alas, they do give him a childhood and a love interest.  I don't quite agree with this aspect of the story, but it was interesting to watch and kept me entertained.The movie starts getting really good when it returns to the original story. The part of the movie where the Grinch prepares to steal Christmas. You'll note that Jim Carrey even sings the song ""Your a mean one, Mr. Grinch"" and does it really well.  Nice job!Jim Carrey seemed to give the Grinch an unusual accent in this film, it's like a bad Sean Connery.  I wasn't quite sure if it would work at first, but it does!The narration was down pretty well, but they did change up the original poem to work with the new story, so it's not exactly the same.All in all, this is a great holiday film.  It's not Ron Howard's best film, it's not Jim Carrey's best film, but it's a darn, gee-golly gosh, fun movie and I suggest that you give it a chance.","

","Ron Howard's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", though beautiful to look at, takes far too many liberties with Dr. Seuss's classic to have the same name. This film is undoubtedly stunning in its visuals and make-up, but something is missing from the original story.  I left the theater not feeling the joys of the Christmas season running through me like I was hoping.The main problem I had with the movie is that the entire theme of the original story/cartoon was lost in the feature film.  The whole subplot of how the grinch became the grinch did some to develop his character, but left us feeling negatively about the whos.  Also, it seemed as though the whos needed more schooling in the meaning of Christmas than did the Grinch.  I thought he was quite justified in rejecting the over-commercialized, self-indulgent ritual that the self-centered whos participated in every year.I'd recommend this movie for people that like a lot of eye-candy in their movies and Jim Carrey fans.  But as for that one movie of the holiday season that brings tears to our eyes and makes us think deeply about the true meaning of the Christmas--I'm still waiting.","

","If you like Jim Carrey, you will love How The Grinch Stole Christmas. He is simply great with the rest of the cast simply along for the ride. The script offers so many little asides that probably Carrey contributed much of it. It is a film for age 10 and above. Small children might be frightened by some of the scary moments. You will get more than a few laughs and you will smile throughout the whole film. Well worth the $5.50 I paid. Each your heart out. I'm a senior!","

","I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Although I admit I like Jim Carrey and the Grinch cartoon, I figured putting them together would be a disaster.It wasn't. The movie is different enough from the cartoon that it's interesting to watch, and I wasn't constantly comparing the two. Anthony Hopkins is no Boris Karloff, but with the extended plot the movie doesn't rely on the narrator NEARLY as much as the cartoon did. (Not that Hopkins was really bad, it's just that Karloff was that much better.)","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594408/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594408,NA," An interesting update!!!
","Who honestly has not seen the original ""Grinch"" cartoon?  The wonderful message, the fantastic imagery, and Boris Karloff's legendary narration made it a Christmas classic (when I sang the theme song for a high school Christmas choir concert, a couple of years ago, the audience instantly recognized and loved the song).  So, when I heard that there was a live-action remake in the works.  I though of only one word: ""How?""  That seemed to me at the time to be the most impossible story to remake in live-action.  While other people were excited, I was incredibly skeptical. That is why I was so pleased with this new version. Basically, there are two reasons that this is a film to be seen.  The first is obviously Jim Carrey.  I have been a big fan of his work since his breakthrough in ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"".  Even if the film that he is making is not very good, he manages to give 110% in that role.  This role will most likely be listed as one of his best.  To play a character that is as firmly rooted in children's minds as Mickey Mouse, Harry Potter, or The Wicked Witch Of The West is a tremendous honor for an actor, and Jim Carrey knows this.  He plays each scene, each LINE like it is his last.  He commits his face, his voice, and his body fully to this role.  It does not take too long to forget that Jim Carrey is simply playing the Grinch.  You believe that he IS the Grinch.  That is only the second time that Jim Carrey has done that to me (""Man On the Moon"" being the first). The other notable aspect of this film is the art direction, which is simply breathtaking.  Since the town of Whoville is enclosed in a snowflake, the crew has taken great pains to show us a place that is not of this world. All of the noses are microscopic, the buildings are bent, and the cars are more suited for a circus than a city street.  This film belongs on a list with other films such as ""Star Wars"", ""Metropolis"", and almost every Tim Burton film as a movie that created a incredibly good-looking world.  This is the type of film that you could spend the entire time just looking at the corners of the screen and still be entertained. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" has a central message in it which states that ""Christmas is not something that is bought in a store.""  Well, this film shows that a good movie is not something that is bought in a store. Most of the Hollywood that I have seen consists of filmmakers who either (1) wonder why their ""artistic"" film did not appeal to a wide audience, or (2) why their summer blockbuster was widely made fun of.  Both types should study this film, which manages to be cheesy and wonderful at the same time, and is going to be hugely successful, judging by the opening box-office.","

","We grew up watching the ""Grinch"" special on TV and I was excited about seeing how it would translate to the big screen ... needless to say, we were a little disappointed. My husband I were counting the minutes until it was over - it dragged so much. (Even my 7 year old didn't like it.) Here is the good & bad: Jim Carrey was great, there were some funny parts & I enjoyed seeing Whoville come to life & felt that the set was incredible, but the plot was not nearly strong enough for a movie that long. There were chunks of time, anywhere from 10-15 minutes, where nothing was happening - knock about 30 minutes off it would have been much better.","

","I really enjoyed this film. Jim Carrey is the hardest working man in Hollywood, and here he gives it everything he's got. His performance as The Grinch makes the film. Ron Howard wants to be a friendlier version of Tim Burton in this film, which is not a bad thing. He gives the film a washed out looked, full of drab reds to show the Grinch's distain for the whole holiday. The screening I was at was full of children, all of whom seemed to be enjoying themselves. This was a near-perfect adaptation of the cartoon to the big screen.","

Yes, it was entertaining in a leave-your-brain-at-the-door sort of way, and maybe I was expecting it to be just like the great book and excellent TV adaptation, and maybe that's why I was disappointed.  It was painfully obvious that they stretched a short story that was stretched into a 30-minute TV special into a 90-minute film. Visually, it looked very static and I wasn't drawn in emotionally to care about any of the characters.  I would have much preferred to see someone with more range, like Robin Williams,  playing the Grinch, instead of he's-covered-with-green-fur-but-I-can-still-tell-it's Jim Carrey.

","Yes, they added some things; this is, after all, Hollywood, and I suppose it'd have be a lot shorter film if he just stole Christmas.  While sets of the Grinch's lair were stunning, much of the added plot doesn't work well. Any filler-plot and average jokes were more than made up for with good acting and the impressive sets/visual effects (the scenes with The Grinch actually stealing Christmas are, for lack of better word, cute).Simply put, Jim Carrey IS The Grinch.  Though at times almost unrecognizable under the makeup and potbelly, Carrey adds his own spirit to make such an unlovable character quite lovable, even when his heart was a few sizes too small.  While other actors did good jobs, this was Carrey's movie; he couldn't be touched, and rightfully so.In the end, its a great holiday movie, with a timeless theme, and may be a ""fun for the whole family"" movie that for once actually lives up to that description, but the animated version is still better.","

How the Grinch Stole Christmas will be as remembered as the cartoon version that so many of us have seen many times before.  Jim Carrey portaited the Grinch quiet well if you ask me.  He seems to have put a bit more depth into the character.  I also however liked the narration done by the great Anthony Hopkins.  Though he will never replace Boris Karloff.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594386/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594386,NA," You're a mean one... Mr. Grinch....
","I've been gone for a while, due to me directing and shooting a movie and my computer having a very bad virus I haven't done a review in a while. I have seen a lot of movies, and now it's time to play ""catch-up"" and I'm going to start with the most antcipated film, THE GRINCH.  Ron Howard does his take on the popular Dr. Suess story which has become a Christmas tradition to tell, and the Chuck Jones cartoon is still one of the most popular programs to watch during the holiday season. But what a lot of people are asking is, ""how can you take a twenty page story and turn it into a 108 minute film?""  Well, I'll tell you. In the quaint little town of Whoville, where the Who's live and play, Christmas is coming and everyone is getting excited.  But little Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor Momsen) questions Christmas, she wonders on what does Christmas mean and why is it so special. Her parents, Dru Lou-Who (Jeremy Howard) and Betty Lou-Who (Molly Shannon) don't really give her a definite answer.  And the Mayor of Whoville (Jeffrey Tambor) is to busy planning the big Christmas celebration.  So Cindy decides that the meaning of Christmas is to care for others, and there's one person who needs the most caring, the Grinch.  The Grinch (Jim Carrey) lives on top of a mountain shadowing Whoville.  The Grinch stands there and with a evil stare wonders what those Who's do down there.  Cindy asks the Grinch if he would like to be the honory guest for the Whoville Christmas celebration.  Which has the Grinch open up emotional scars from his past which include the town's volumptious Martha May Who-vier (Christine Baranski). And because of the old scars opening up again, the Grinch hatches a plan to take away the Christmas spirit from Whoville. I noticed that this movie is getting some negative reviews from critics, and all I can ask is the same question Little Cindy Lou Who asked the Grinch dressed up as Santa, ""why?""  This was a very touching and enjoyable film that shows what Christmas is about, that you should share it with your loved ones and to love those who are not loved that much.  It sends the audience a positive message instead of a depressing or corny message that one would expect. The acting is done very well for this film, Taylor Momsen is good as Little Cindy Lou who is trying to find out the real meaning of Xmas.  And there is good support from Molly Shannon, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Jeremy Howard, and of course Clint Howard (who makes his usual appearance in his bro's films).  As for Jim Carrey's performance, all I can say is this. I use to spite Jim Carrey's films.  I rolled my eyes in aggervation while watching ACE VENTURA and LIAR LIAR.  I wondered why this man was so popular. Then with such gems as TRUMAN SHOW, MAN ON THE MOON, and ME MYSELF & IRENE it showed that Mr. Carrey, along with Kevin Spacey takes acting very seriously, but also likes to have fun with it.  And there is nothing wrong with that, most popular Hollywood actors should take a lesson from that.  And I felt that Jim Carrey was robbed on not getting a acting nomination for TRUMAN SHOW and MAN ON THE MOON.  So I have a bad feeling that Jim Carrey is going to get robbed again for a Oscar nomination for THE GRINCH.  Which is a very bad shame, cause Carrey is the best Grinch that I can think of anyone playing.  Jack Nicholson was the original choice, then he realized that Ron Howard wanted someone to play a Grinch, not someone who is a Grinch.  Smart move by Ron Howard, since Carrey gives another fantastic performance in this film. The sets, costumes, effects are also very well done.  I liked how Howard takes the look of the ""wobbly"" shaped buildings of Whoville and makes them three dimension.  Also the costumes are quite something to see since they are vary and they are also unusual.  The effects are also very well done, making the world of Whoville seem realistic.  But it's Rick Baker who comes out on top, again, as the make-up artist for the film.  I mean, gee, if you saw the picture of Jim Carrey as the Grinch five years ago, no one would believe you.  And I think that Baker should get another Oscar win for this film, and place that Oscar next to his four or so other Oscars that he has won (I lost count). And Ron Howard does a great job by making the movie at times touching, and at other times wacky.  He adds nice touches from the original Suess classic to make the story of the Grinch and the residents of Whoville seem more realistic.  Granted, the film isn't perfect, but I can't think of anyone else who would take this film that seriously as Howard did.      THE GRINCH is a wonderful movie, and it's a excellent holiday film.  I would put this film along side with IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and A CHRISTMAS STORY among the best Christmas films of all time.  And who knows what Dr. Suess book to film will be done next?   Rumor has that it will be CAT IN THE HAT with Tim Allen and the cat.  I would personally like to see PONTOFFEL POCK made into a feature.  And I liked to see someone direct the feature version of a little known Suess book called THE SEVEN LADY GODIVAS (that would be intresting to see).  But GRINCH is a great holiday film.  I can't see how kids will be scared of the Grinch.  He too has a heart and can be friendly (if he wants to).  ***** (out of five)","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594385/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594385,8," It's a Family Affair
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Check out the number of ""Howard"" surnames listed in the credits.  I counted four, but may have missed some. Dedicating the film to his recently deceased mother, Ron Howard was the perfect choice for directing this Dr. Seuss adaptation.  Mr. Howard has a real feel for family relationships and that plays a key part in the theme of the Grinch vs. Who-ville.  Howard, as usual, cast numerous members of his own family in the film.  This includes, the always good for a laugh, brother Clint.  Jim Carrey again proves that he is a tremendous acting talent.  ""The Truman Show"" followed by ""Man on the Moon"" and now this!  We are are blessed to watch such a uniquely talented performer perfect his craft.  If you say the Grinch role required little acting, you are wrong.  Carrey captures the true spirit of the role, and a wide range of emotions, while toting make-up that makes it impossible to recognize him.  My one complaint with the film is the extremely weak version of the Grinch theme song.  Done wonderfully creepy in the original TV special, the song is so light-hearted in the film that it loses the punch it is supposed to pack.  My tidbit on this one is to be sure and catch the Ron Howard parody performed by Jim Carrey as he doffs a ball cap and begins mimmicing the director.  This was most assuredly a Carrey ad lib that made the final cut.  My request of Jim Carrey is: PLEASE get over the butt fetish!","

","SPOILER WARNING: If you don't know how the story ends, don't read this review!Jim Carrey, the human cartoon, was an obvious choice for this movie, for obvious reasons - he can bring cartoonish behavior to any role and can be very entertaining. When taking a children's book which had already been expanded to a 26 minute animated film and expanding it to a full length feature film, something had to be added to fill the void. Carrey is also known for pushing the envelope on what is acceptable or funny, which is great for films targeted for adults, but not so great for a kid's flick. This film not only missed the mark on a G rating, but was given a PG-13 rating. I would rather have seen a film with less ass-kissing (yes, literally) and more appropriate for the 12 and under set for which the original animated cartoon is perfect. In the end, a very funny Grinch gets the girl, but doesn't seem transformed like the one we see in the cartoon version of the same story. Jim Carrey is the best part of this movie, but it still isn't enough to carry it through. I give it a 6 out of 10.","

Of course, there are some slow parts of the show.  It was to be expected when you are trying to make a respectably long feature length film out of a 30 minute cartoon.  Even though the supporting cast plays almost no part in the main part of the movie, Carrey picks this movie up on his shoulders and makes it one of the most hilarious laughs of the year.","

","Dr. Seuss' ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"", has been airing every year on television since the 60's, and every year, I enjoy watching it over and over again, so, I could not wait to see this movie. And the movie definately does not disappoint!! Fantastic sets, a great cast, and a great job by director Ron Howard bring the holiday classic to life.The Grinch lives on a mountain above Whoville, where all the Who's enjoy their favorite time of the year....Christmas! However, the Grinch does not like Christmas, and he sets out on a mission to ruin it for the happy go lucky Who's.The feat of turning a 22 minute cartoon into a feature was not easy, however director Ron Howard really did a great job. There are also some interesting bits where we get to see just how the Grinch got to live at the top of the mountain, what he was like as a child, and they even give him a love interest!!Really great retelling of the story! Jim Carrey is just splendid as the Grinch, and the narration by Sir Anthony Hopkins, adds a sort of class to the film. Get your family together, and enjoy watching this new retelling of a classic story.Merry Christmas!!","

",I saw The Grinch when it first came out with my ten year old niece Cassi. It was pretty cute. Jim Carrey played a good part as the Grinch. The little girl was annoying. Otherwise the movie was good. I give it 8/10. The cartoon was much better. I liked the dog. The dog was cool. Except i would have had a rotweiler dog. Cool Movie Otherwise.,"

","I'm not sure where to start with this movie.  I just didn't care for it too much.  First of all the character of the Grinch.  Many stories featuring him display him as pure evil, in this  movie, he was far from that, he was more eccentric than anything else, and just plain weird.  And why did Cindy Lou become such a central character in the story?  Also, she look like she was much older than two, and above all the ending was w-a-a-a-a-a-y too corny.I have to hand them a little credit for make-up and special effects but as for everything else, do yourself a favor kids and watch the animated version by Chuck Jones, or better yet, read the book!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594303/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594303,NA," The Grinch does not steal your money!!
","Every Holiday season studios rush to release their film, which they think, will become a Christmas classic. This year, Universal Pictures in association with Imagine Entertainment release The Grinch', a comic fantasy starring Jim Carrey. Does this movie fall into the aforementioned category? No. This delightful holiday film is destined to become a classic due to its' over the top look and zany performance by Carrey himself.     Carrey plays the titular character who lives just above the town of Whoville, one Christmas after an unsettling experience provided by the townspeople, he decides to steal all the good holiday cheer and steal Christmas. But his plans become thwarted by a sweet little girl from that town, and the rest is pretty much history. Credit definitely goes to Howard and his team who put together a simply stunning looking film, which is also incredibly enjoyable. It seems as if they stole the Disney formula for a successful family film. Hire a lead that both parents and kids can relate to, sprinkle a bit of comedy and a touch of comprehensible story and voila  a decent film. But in this case, the end result is as magical as the book itself. Forgive me if I am into the Christmas spirit, but anyone who does not enjoy this film must definitely be a Grinch. The perceptive filmgoers will ask themselves one question, how do you turn a 15-page book into a feature film? Well, this is where Ron Howard excels. He uses the book as simply the third act in the film. The first act of the film recounts the legend of the Grinch and his childhood. The second act revolves around his acceptance in the town after a long absence, which ultimately backfires and causes to get even with the town. Resulting in him stealing Christmas.     Howard puts forward enough eye candy to satisfy even the youngest viewer, yet supplies enough wit through Carrey's character to satisfy even the most meticulous adult. Jim Carrey's portrayal of the Grinch is simply astonishing. By the end of the film a smart moviegoer will want more. He brings to the movie his regular sense of physical comedy that works incredibly, but this character allows him to expand his speech patterns and body language to a level we the viewers have never seen before. Simply put, he is a real treat to watch. And the film is a definite treat. The reason why this movie works so well is because through the first act, you can see why The Grinch has a grudge against the people of Whoville. His perspective is explicitly stated, although it was conjured by writers of today and relates in no way to the original book. It is interesting to see the take on why he is such a mean one. And from there on, the movie is simply a delight. Furthermore, another reason why it is fun to watch is because it is not scared to make fun of itself in the process. And when it goes over the top, as one can see through the Grinch's drive on a car two times smaller than he, it goes way over the top. Leaving the audience to one resort -  laughter.      While many were skeptics about Carrey's portrayal and the direction of the film under Howard, all doubts can be put aside upon completion of the film. It is a pure, wonderful, fantastical journey that we have never seen before, and it is exceptionally well done. A true winner that will definitely become a Holiday classic. 
Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of four)","

","The movie ""How the Grinch stole Christmas"" is a very nice movie for children. It has a suitably festive Christmas feeling, and the character of the Grinch is very funny. This is definitely one of Jim Carrey's best roles.The plot begins very pleasing indeed - we learn that there is this Grinch who hates Christmas, and hilarity ensues when he is invited to celebrate Christmas with the Whos. But when the Grinch's past is explained, the whole plot breaks down and flattens. I mean, a romance story? That's so clichéd it's terrible. What's more, it totally demolishes the character potential in the Grinch and makes him just another Who, who just happens to be green instead of pink.The way I would have written the ending would be that the Grinch is actually of a species naturally hostile to Whos, one which preys on them, for example. Since this species prefers solitude, the Grinch settled away from others, but the Whos just happened to build their village next to him.If you don't mind the story, go see this film. It's worth it for Jim Carrey's acting alone.","

","I remember during the early summer, I would start seeing a lot of commerical trailers for a new Christmas-related movie.  It was a big-screen adaption of a classic children's story (and an equally classic cartoon by Chuck Jones) modeled after...who else, but the Grinch!  With Jim Carrey as the title character, I knew I had to see this one.  He, and director Ron Howard, I could tell, where going to bring it to life!  So, along came November, 2000.  I was there to see this movie on its opening night (I often like to) and this turned out to be a very funny movie.  It contained a true-to-the-book style story, and I, at some point, forgot this was Jim Carrey playing the Grinch.  He just belonged in this movie.  The supporting cast is fun to watch, and Cindy-Lou Who gets more screen time than she did in the book and cartoon.  But don't worry, the Grinch is still the leading character.  Dr. Seuss would more than likely be satisfied.  It was easy to see why this movie became the highest grossing movie of 2000.  If another Dr. Seuss book was made into a movie, which one do you think they would they do next, maybe a live-action ""Cat in the Hat""?  GROSS-OUT ALERT!!!: If you enjoyed your lunch, you should turn away for this one scene.  In the remix of, ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"", remember the lyrics, ""you've got termites in your smile""?  Well, then, Mr. Grinch decides to show us they're not kidding...","

","I personally thought that 'The Grinch' was fantastic. I loved the clever choice of characters and I especially love the Grinch's dog, Max. Okay, the jokes are pretty lame and Jim Carrey doesn't give the best performance yet, but It is still a great film that a selection of people will enjoy The whole design concept of this movie is amazing. The make up, set design... everything was outstanding and was visually stunning. I appreciated this film because it shows us how the Christmas spirit can make us all feel happy- even if we don't particularly like Christmas. Quite a few people have commented on how 'crap' and how 'boring' this movie was. For those people, just think a little bit. If you look at the effort that has gone into the film, you have to like something about it! No body can actually say that the fine detail put into 'Whoville' and the clever designs weren't satisfying. One negative comment. I thought maybe that it could have been slightly more humorous (but it still was funny in parts)but I cannot complain because it is obvious the film was aimed at children.Overall, **** out of *****If you haven't seen it- its worth checking out... OH!, and narration by Anthony Hopkins was also a bonus.","

","This is one of those movies that I initially felt ambiguous about.  On one side, there were some pretty interesting visuals.  On another, the characters were terrifyingly ugly and Carrey, as the Grinch, was annoying. The movie itself isn't terrible, I suppose, but it's pretty bad.  The best reason I can imagine for this is the fact that Howard attempted to stretch a rather short story into the cast of a two-hour film.  He didn't succeed.","

I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan, at least not in this type of movie (as opposed to the Truman Show or Man on the Moon). However, the set, the makeup, and the costumes were really excellent, and made the movie worth seeing. I hope that it gets an award for some aspect of design, because that was really its saving grace. I thought the message at the end was kind of interesting: it was a little bit of preachy anti-consumerism, interesting considering the money this movie made not just in ticket sales but various Grinch paraphanalia.","

","DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four)If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable, don't see ""Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of  the fictional village Whoville. Unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end;  the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. However, I will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who's from their Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. Like in ""Battlefield Earth,"" I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless, there is SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, the later playing  Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor, Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is the Grinch's lone lost lover.The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou. The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity!The movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack, and the ample makeup department. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a very good-looking production. The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream. The people of  Whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines. Although dazzling, I really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about. His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss.  Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from Jim Carry's zany silliness. It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part. This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas.""After this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave.","

","Since this is a Christmas movie, I'll be as kind as I can while still being honest.I gave the movie a 6, but only because I felt the movie's production values off-set the disappointing adaptation.I think that most people, regardless of how they felt about the movie after seeing it, would agree on one thing: Jim Carrey is very much his ""usual self"" (think Ace Ventura, Mask, Tony Clifton, and a half dozen vague impersonations).  For those who are fans of Jim Carrey's manic over-the-top delivery, this is... fine.  For those who aren't, it will undoubtedly ruin the experience for them.Had I never seen the original ""Grinch"" book or cartoon, I most likely would have enjoyed this movie a lot more.  Unfortunately, I've read/seen them several times throughout my life, making it very difficult to separate them from what I was viewing on-screen.  Had I not been overly familiar with Jim Carrey's usual mannerisms, I would have been able to more easily lose myself in the Seuss-like environment.  Unfortunately, I kept seeing the Grinch bursting into seemingly un-Grinchy comedy bits.  (What did the ""Ron Howard as director"" sketch have to do with anything?)Now, the good points: the scenery, while not exactly natural-looking, definitely had that curvey, distorted Seuss-like perspective, with the occasional dash of Chuck Jones-ian skewed angles as well. The makeup was incredible on everyone, the computer animation segments were impressive enough to fool most people, and Anthony Hopkin's narrative portions were the closest one could get to the original story.--------------------- SPOILER WARNING: If you haven't seen the movie and you intend to, don't read the next paragraph.  Skip to the paragraph after that one.  Thank you.--------------------- A few gripes: Could they have come up with a more disturbing method to have the Grinch's heart grow two sizes? It looked quite painful.  Also, since when did the Grinch harbor Oscar the Grouch sensibilities?  His lair resembled a cross between Blankman's secret headquarters, Oscar's trash can, and Pee-Wee's Playhouse.  Max the dog, while well-trained, seemed a bit too much like Benji; and Cindy-Lou Who, who was ""no more than two"", is suddenly six or seven and more intelligent than the entire adult population.  At times I felt like I was watching ""Horton Hears A Hackneyed Cliche'"": the mysterious orphan in a basket, the alienated  child, the unrequitted love; at one point, I felt like I was watching Disney's ""Hunchback Of Notre Dame,"" when they gave the Grinch an award and ultimately humiliated him in public, much to the dismay of the secret love interest. -----------------------------For those of you who didn't read the spoiler, it's okay, I'm done ranting now.  I went into the movie really wanting to like it - expecting to like it, in fact.  I went away feeling a bit like Cindy-Lou Who did at one point in the film: Too much shallow sentimentality and glittery flash, not enough 'keeping it real'.  It's a cute Christmas movie, and somewhere in it there's a moral, albeit a muddled one; but if you're looking for a faithful recreation of a cartoon classic, you might have better luck with ""Popeye"", ""Inspector Gadget"", and ""Casper"".  (Then again, maybe not.)","

","I've been a fan of Carrey's since his early stand-up days at the Improv and Comedy Store and am delighted by his success. There seems to be nothing this guy can't do. The Grinch is no different. This is a fun-filled eye-treat that will leave you in a good mood after seeing. The expansion of the Grinch's story is good,especially(not to give too much away)his earlier years. I'll admit I almost walked out early on in the film when Cindy Lou Who broke into song,but that was the only real maudlin moment. Ninety percent of this movie is Jim Carrey and he makes the most of it. I could have done without some of the adult humor that Ron Howard and the writers seemed compelled to inject,such as the Who-Ville party in the flashback involving keys or the Grinch's use of his dog with a sleeping mayor. But that aside,it was a fun Christmas movie. It may not make you forget the original cartoon,but it's worth a look or two. And Jim rules!","

","The costumes and make-up were grand, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing. Sure this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of Dr Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It's worth a see, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic, by any measure.","

","Ironic that Dr. Seuss' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season.  The general gist of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen).  This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss' story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones' animated version.  Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly.  There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing.Succinctness?Soul?Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better.   I give this film three cans of Who-Hash out of five.","

The Grinch is publicly humiliated and plans the destruction of everybodys holiday.The sets and special effects are terrific. Jim Carrey totally transforms himself into the role.

","Perhaps I liked this movie more than most because I've never particularly cared for Suess. It wasn't so much his verse that I had a problem with, but those headache-inducing illustrations that everyone seems to hail as groundbreaking. Even when I was the target age for these books, those images didn't inspire my imagination, they scared the hell out of me. Hmmm... perhaps that's a form of inspiration, but not a very fun one for a small child.I never cared for the cartoon Grinch, either -- and why would I, when I didn't care for Suess? The movie, however, struck me in a certain way, a way that I can't say for certain I loved the movie, but I did find it mildly enjoyable. The sets and the costumes had just the right touch of outlandishness, picking up on the Suess vibe but without the nauseating effects found within the books. Some things could have used improvement or outright deletion. When Cindy Lou Who decided to sing, off-key, about Christmas, I took the opportunity to hit the snack bar. We really could have done without that scene, Mr. Howard.It seemed like there should have been more to the rivalry between Baranski's character and Shannon's character. The scene with the lighting machine gun was cute, but that's where the subplot ended. It would appear as if whatever else there was to this story was sliced from the film, save for this scene, because the director needed a mechanism to introduce a character that was a key to the conflict between the MayWho and the Grinch.
The movie attempts to lead the audience with timing gaps for when, it seems, we were supposed to laugh. It didn't work. There were quite a few laughs, but none for those uncomfortable pauses.Despite all this, I managed to enjoy the film. It seems that everyone else who attended enjoyed this film, too. There were no bloody carcasses in the aisles, nor were there any weeping widows or orphans on hand to sob at reporters about what a tradgedy the whole affair was, the world did not end, civilization did not fall, and the price of milk did not go up -- things that, judging by the dramatic comments of my fellow IMDB-ers, can be blamed directly on this movie when it plays in other parts of this world.I have a feeling that this film is destined to become a holiday classic and tradition. If the idea shocks, disgusts, and horrifies some of the people who have become a little too emotional over an adaptation of a children's story, then I can't think of anything I would like more.","

Ron Howard certainly has come a long way from his role as the shrimp Winthrop in ""The Music Man"".

","I know I've lost a little childhood innocence over the years, and God knows how jaded I've become about my views regarding the lackluster, weak and poorly conceived material upon which so many big-studio productions are based. So it's no wonder that ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" as visually stunning and technically complex as it was, didn't quite knock my socks off. As usual, Jim Carrey was his over-the-top self, and I admit the film's premise and lead/title character pretty much beg for a zealous actor like Carrey. Nevertheless, the film wasn't whimsical or enchanting enough to suck me in, probably because in-between the Grinch's ranting and raving, my heartstrings couldn't penetrate the incredible makeup, costumes and set designs long enough to latch onto anything very real or genuine. In other words, the visual intensities almost worked against the film at times, obscuring reality and creating distractions that were just too effective. Of course, for the small fry and others seeking a purely visceral, sensorial experience, the film certainly succeeds. And I have to admit I fell in love at first sight with the adorable Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.So, as always, we take the good with the questionable, and we'd give anything to ask the venerable Dr. Seuss himself for his considered opinion.","

","In this day and age, you really can't help being prejudiced towards holiday films like this one.  I went into it very skeptical, thinking it was going to lean a little too much towards the kiddie, cheesy antics that one can easily find from a film such as JINGLE ALL THE WAY.  But being the persistent Jim Carrey fan that I am, I ignored my insight and bought a ticket to THE GRINCH.Thanks to good ol' Richie Cunningham, I was totally amazed at how great the film was.  It did a good job of blending dark humor, much like that of Tim Burton, with old fashioned holiday cheer.  The dark humor, although very brutal at times, had me aching with laughter throughout the entirety of the film.  The surrealness of the world created in the film, along with the various memorable characters, places it among the ranks of other classics such as THE WIZARD OF OZ, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.  And as for the comic maestro Jim Carrey, his performance sort of resembles that of another green mischief-maker in THE MASK.  I'm sure the basis for every critic's approach to this film was to compare it to the original.  Bad move.  It is an unfair judgement to compare this film to the original especially because it transcends it in so many ways.  This film is perfect for all ages and all kinds of people.  So ignore the misguided reviews, buy a ticket, and slip into madness with THE GRINCH.","

","How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a 1966 classic, but why did they have to remake it? Well, I'll tell you what. It was a bad idea. A disastrous idea, if you will...The Grinch is pretty much plotless. A little girl, Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), wonders whether the evil Grinch (Jim Carrey) really is all that dastardly and tries to befriend him. The Grinch isn't having any of it and attempts to ruin the Christmas celebrations until, lo and behold, he, and the feckless Whos, discover the much-vaunted true meaning' of Christmas.
Some lovely costumes and nice set pieces can't save this film. The acting is corny, Jim Carrey is effortless in his attempt to be The Grinch, while Taylor Momsen is unbearable as the dumb-ass little cheesy kid, Cindy Lou Who. On the subject of the Who's...could you get any more annoying, by any chance? Their big noses and wide smiles used to be classical, now they are please-kill-me irritating. Ron Howard's direction is the only thing that is average, and perhaps Anthony Hopkins narration can be credited too.Someone once called this remake memorable. Well, the only thing that is memorable about it is how bad it is.I rate The Grinch 3 out of 10.","

","The previous reviews excoriating this movie are exactly right.  But it's more than just a disappointment--it maligns what the cartoon and the book were all about.  This movie isn't really even about Christmas--maybe politically correct Hollywood can't bring itself to make a real Christmas anymore. For those who really liked the cartoon growing up--personally I never missed it--this movie gives mental images to the Grinch that you don't want. The Grinch was always mean, but in a sonorous dignified way, how else could he be with Boris Karloff as his voice?  Carrey turns him into a total buffoon, who's not even the least bit scary, just pathetic. Adding on the absurd childhood trauma episode to attempt explain the development of the Grinch's meanness wasn't even laughable, just a diminishing of the character.   
The Whos are entirely different in character, losing all the charm of the originals.  I get the sense that Carrey's wild overacting, even for him, was as a result of all the makeup they layered over him, he wanted you to know he was in there.  Too bad.  The sole redeeming virtue was the dog who played max--he had the only scenes worth watching.  Avoid this turkey at all costs, so you can enjoy your Who Beast without an upset stomach.","

","I can't say I was overly surprised by Carrey's performance. The gumby-bendy toy was disguised under a green suit, but the insufferable quips and 'ad-libs' make his identity pretty clear. Which is a shame. His 'bigness' and cartoon-inspired personality made him a natural for this, but as usual he sinks into cheap shots. The cultural references that took me out of the Suessian world were what bothered me most. I came to see the Grinch, not Jim Carrey as, well, a bad imitation of Jim Carrey.The cinematography was a mess too. The film had a chance to be visually stunning, but went for visual overload instead. Completely artless. I would have loved to see what someone with a real sense of style (ie. Tim Burton) could have done.While I'm recasting, Anthony Hopkins as the Narrator was a huge mistake. His voice is dull and uninspired. There is only one voice I can think of that could have replaced Karloff's (mainly because its totally different) and that is James Earl Jones.Sigh.","

","OK, so maybe I'm easily amused, but I enjoyed this treatment of a holiday classic.  I liked the balance of the dark atmosphere against the holiday season, and the satire on the overcommercialization of Xmas is excellent, although it loses steam later on.  Jim Carrie comes through about as expected, although I did find one scene tasteless and gratuitous.  I wouldn't recommend this movie for extremely young viewers, however.  In many ways, this movie is more the way I would expect Tim Burton to handle it, rather than Ron Howard.  Still a movie well worth seeing. 8/10","

","i am a jim carrey fan. lets get that out of the way first. why you might ask? there are a few 'actors' in hollywood that have been spawned by comedy, some of which have found success (adam sandler, mike myers, bill murrey, eddie murphy etc) and there are those who have not (the cast of saturday night at the roxby for instance). but there are few that can turn their talents to other projects and develop there range of work.jim carrey is, in my opinion, an illusionist/impressionist and at the very top of his class. he gets $20m a picture for a reason. a performers popularity is sustained by his ability to evolve and to adapt to new audiences expectations. carrey has done just that. no longer a one toned actor, has he has proved with the truman show and man on the moon that his ability to act is as strong as his ability to contort & jest. explanation over.so the grinch is another carrey signature role. many have said that carrey was born to play a role, be that kaufman, riddler etc, but here we have another example.i am english so i'm not up on dr.zeuss and all the lingo that goes with it...theres a cat and hat and some thingies and a erm...yeah. but i took the time to find out. i get that its as good as a fairy tale. a fable, a childrens story. thats what ron howard has done. created a breathing fairy tale. with an edge.the cast are sidelined for carreys performance. an all out assault for any filmgoer, be you fan or critic, carrey spits the grinchs curses with gleeful abandon throwing restraint to the wind.is the grinch a good movie though? it is what it is, a fairytale. a bedtime story. magical and amazing in places. i watched the film in november, and as i left the cinema i wanted it to be christmas. i wanted everyone around me to burst into song...well maybe not. but you get the picture.the grinch is a christmas movie and as such should be treated as one. it does what it sets out to do tella story. make you laugh and teach us a moral lesson. oh and also that the bad guy is'nt always to blame.go see it, feel festive and don't eat broken glass.(if you've seen it you'll know)7/10regards and yuletide cheer","

","Coming from England, I didn't really know what The Grinch was. I've seen the cartoon on at Christmas (and of course it's small cameo in Home Alone), but I have never read the book. I must say, it was a nice film to watch. Enjoyable, and funny it made me actually feel good after I'd seen it. When I saw The Grinch, at the London Premiere, I congratulated Ron Howard on a very well made film. He asked me ""Was it too corny?"" Thinking about it.....yes it is, but isn't it supposed to be?I agree that many of Carrey's previous characters are portrayed within The Grinch, The Mask, Andy Kaufman etc, but is that a bad thing? We all loved those characters didn't we? So why shouldn't Jim put them into this role. Everyone in London seemed to enjoy it. I understand that Americans have a different view on the film, due to the books of Dr Suess. You know whether it stays true to the original story or not. We, in England, however, just see it as another Jim Carrey film and expect nothing else.The one thing that we all must agree on is that The Grinch is a much superior film to Me Myself and Irene!! This is a real feel good film and should be seen by everyone over the Christmas season!","

","This is not one of the best Carrey actings. As a matter of fact I don't like him but I don't why I can't stop seeing his movies. Since, Carrey's face is covered by the Grinch's mask it doesn't look as funny when he is doing his actings (minus 1). The character of the grinch is gross and Carrey plays that role nicely. He is gross and disgusting at times (minus two). He came back to his Pet detective type movies (minus one). The movie becomes tedious at times. Nothing like Liar Liar. (minus one). Overall this is a forgettable movie. They could have done more if they had chosen another actor for the Grinch, like Robert De Niro. I guess it's okay if you see it with your children. Bit first try to see the 6th day or the unbreakable. Those are better choices.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594202/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594202,NA," A grand scale disappointment.
","Awaiting this film with great anticipation, I hoped for a great fairy tale come to life type of film.  What I saw, however, was a flawed mess of a movie. Turning such a short book into a feature length film is virtually an impossible challenge.  The fill that has been thrown at us is comprised of Jim Carrey either hamming it up, or a rather unnecessary explanation of the Grinch's motivation.  Apparently he's got issues over being the first kid in the class to shave.  It's understandable that more of the Grinch's past would be thrown into the mix, but what we get is just ridiculous.  He hates Christmas cause he's the Grinch, it's just that easy. And on top of that, he's GREEN.  It really doesn't take shaving to single him out. Jim Carrey, thanks to the amazing makeup job, looks the part perfectly. He pulls it off both vocally and physically.  It's such a shame that his performance here is so much more ACE VENTURA than it is THE TRUMAN SHOW. Between all the mugging and joking, any layers of depth that the character could have otherwise had don't have time to come through.Now before I say anything about Howard's direction, I must say this -- TIM BURTON.  Howard's direction makes Whoville look like a set on a Hollywood soundstage.  This is the kind of world that Burton could have breathed life into, as he consistently does. He has admitted that Dr. Seuss is one of his biggest influences, and it shows in his work.  Howard directed films like Parenthood and Apollo 13 and, while great with films like that, he doesn't quite know how to bring the texture of a surreal fantasy to the screen. All we get is great sets and great production value.  The camera never sees this world with a sense of awe or wonder, but instead with a very dry 'yeah here it is' style. While there are moments in the movie that are enjoyable, the jokes that do work don't belong in this movie and other moments just drive you away from, not further into, the world of Dr. Seuss.  As a movie, it should have been better.  As a grand scale reworking of a classic, it falls terribly short.","

","While I found this movie very entertaining and well done, I couldn't help but realize during the entire thing that I was watching Jim Carey dressed up in a green suit.  Before I attack the character of The Grinch, let me state that I thought many things about this movie were very good.  The sets and lighting were wonderful, the little girl who played Cindy Lou was not annoying like most little kids are, and I thought that the story really moved along.  All of the things that were added to make this 1/2 hour TV special into a movie worked very well.Now, on to The Grinch.  This character seemed to be a culmination of every other character that Jim Carrey has ever played.  I saw pieces of Ace Ventura, The Riddler, The Mask, Andy Kaufman, etc.  This made it hard to determine what the Grinch was really trying to be.  Was he mean, nice, a comedian...what?  I think that if Jim Carrey had been a little less Jim Carrey than this movie would have been much better.  An understated Grinch would have had more impact than the overstated bumbling idiot that Carrey portrayed.  I'm not the world's biggest Jim Carrey fan to begin with, but by the end of this movie I was even less of a fan.  Three words:  Tone it down.I'd recommend seeing this movie, because it is interesting, and 'You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch' is a great song.  But expect to see more Jim Carrey than you can stomach.","

I think most people that have bad things to say about this movie are basing it on the original cartoon. They had to put in some extra ""stuff"" to make it longer and more entertaining...and it did just that.They could have found no one more perfect for the Grinch then Jim Carrey.

","This movie, which was painful to view especially with my 7 year old present, totally destroyed the spirit of Dr. Seuss.  In his book the Grinch was a Grumpy old person who just wanted in the end that the people like him.  In this dark comedy we get a vicious beast that tries to kill a little girl without a thought.   The same beast is sought after by a sex craved woman.The director tried to rip off the Munchkin Land (a la Wizard of Oz) look of the town and does a real poor job of it.  There is a lot of camp in this movie which is really poor quality (maybe the director should have watched some old Batman on TV to find out how to get it right).If you are taking the kids I suggest Rugrats in Paris which is a thoroughly entertaining film for both children and adults.  It is also one that you can feel safe taking the smaller kids to unlike this muddled affair.","

But if your looking for a movie to take the kids to this is it, though I suggest renting the cartoon - it's much more entertaining. I found this movie to be nothing more than eye candy.

","Ron Howard's treatment of the classic Dr. Seuss cartoon deserves both applause and a shame-on-you.  Technically, the movie is without flaw (as far as I could tell).  The story, however, suffers from two decidedly un-Seuss-like scenes which both involve the Grinch doing something VERY bizarre: in one scene, the Grinch gives the mayor a doggie-style moon pie kiss; in another, he gives Cindy Who a drink of water whilst standing behind a tree (the sound of a liquid falling into a glass is heard, and Cindy gives the contents a dubious look as she goes to bed).  The voice of the Grinch audibly changes during the course of the movie -- a sign that dubbing was involved.  But, this detracts only a little from the movie.Hardcore Seuss fans (and I am one) quickly noted the differences between the original cartoon and the movie.  True, the material with which Mr Howard had to work was sparse; it was disturbing, however, to see the Grinch stumble through a hairy childhood and become a reclusive miscreant after shaving his face badly.With the exception of the mousy makeup on most of the Whoville characters, the Whos were represented fairly well.  The hair styles were delightfully obscene, and the non-euclidian geometry of the buildings and streets was pure Seuss.I feel that the movie was not worth the price at the ticketbox and should, instead, be viewed when the DVD hits the rental stores.","

I couldn't wait for that part.  I knew that scene would leave me busting a stitch.  But that highlight was also humdrum.But I have to admit, though Jim Carrey's facial expressions were unbelievable, I felt the puppy was the star of the show!I wanted so badly to love and caress this movie.  I wanted to laugh aloud --  But I couldn't.  I remember when Jurassic Park first hit the big screen.  Everyone took there kids to see a pleasant Disney-like movie about dinosaurs.  But instead, got a movie that was so realistic and terrifying that kids were clinging to their parents.  Yes, Jurassic Park was phenomenal. But the Grinch isn't.Why?  Because you expect a T-Rex to be deadly.  And so be it. Throughout Jurassic Park, the T-Rex was a dangerous animal from start to finish.  The Grinch, however, was too much of a psychopath.  You're left wondering whether you can trust the Grinch even as the movie ends.Jim Carrey was awesome.  The back-drop was incredible. Even down to every detail having squiggly-shapes, with nothing having right-angles.  Even the ladder in the mailroom was crooked. A lot of attention was focused on the set, but the Grinch's script was too dark and too unsettling of a character.It was like a Disney set that was exploited by Tim Burton. Rating: 6 stars out of 10.","

","I am, to say the least, not one of Jim Carey's fans, but he does a fine job as the Grinch in this film.I realize that extras had to added to this film in order to make it long enough to qualify as a feature film, and for the most part, the additions are fine.I am a professional musician, and what offends me most about this film is the stupid, sappy song that was inserted into things for no reason, apparently, other than to have a soundtrack to sell.  The song is sung by Cindy Lou Who, and it is as awful a song as has ever been written, not just because the child playing the waif has a bad singing voice, but because it is one of those plastic sappy songs that the public seems to buy in bag-loads these days.  Thank God that the Grinch Song (You're a mean one...Mister Grinch, etc.) from the original Chuck Jones film from the 60s was included, or I would have felt nothing but animosity towards this film.OK...that aside, I think this film does a fine job with the story.  A lot of the plotting as to how the Grinch got like he is, is predictable, but I can live with that quite easily.  Everything comes out fine in the end as it should, and we're left with a swell grin on our faces.  What more do you want from a shadow play?So...go see it.  If disgusting music doesn't offend you, you'll love it, and if it does, well...it's really a minor problem.  Like the summary line says, it's worth the price of admission.","

","There's a reason why animation (i.e., cartoons) often succeeds where live action does not: if one can suspend disbelief long enough to interpret two-dimensional line drawings as ""people"", then the story is accepted by the brain, even if the ""people"" fly, change into rabbits, or turn purple. With live action, though, if all one can think of is, ""that makeup doesn't look right"", then one can't be drawn into the story. This is one of the major faults with this new GRINCH: disbelief not only can't be suspended; it can't even get into the harness. For example, it's hard to accept that with this picture's budget, they used sets with such glaringly fake snow and rocks. It reminded me of some of the pop singers' TV Christmas specials of the 1960s.   Whoville, though, was mostly well done. The costumes and crazy hairdos were wonderful, as were the cars and general trappings of the town.","

","I saw The Grinch in a near empty BAFTA screening with only a couple of kids in the audience.  But the movie is not only for kids.  The screenplay throws up a fair amount of jokes and set pieces aimed at adults.Jim Carrey is brilliant and truly has made character of The Grinch his own. He would steal the show, if it wasn't already his by default.His supporting cast do admirable jobs. Taylor Momsen is cute and sweet as Cindy Lou Who while Christine Baranski plays a variation of her Marianne character from Cybill as Martha May Whovier, the love of The Grinch's life.Rick Baker's make up is fantastic, Rita Ryack's costumes are extremely well made and hats off to Michael Corenblith for his production designs.The movie itself has a certain charm and will be loved by a large amount of people.  Carrey plays to the audience in a similar style as he did in The Mask.And let's not forget that the movie carries a message - that Christmas is NOT all about gifts, but about being together.Can't wait for ""Green Eggs and Ham"" to hit the screens!","

","I very much wanted to like this film.  It was OK, but I can only give it half marks.The visuals were great, and the costumes and general style are largely faithful to Seuss (albeit much richer).There were some genuinely funny moments.  But the humor is very inane compared to vintage Seuss. The Seuss style of humor came through the twinkling of an eye -  this movie delivers it intravenously.In typical Carey style, the movie is very fast paced and erratic.  A gentler, more thoughtful, portrayal of The Grinch would have been welcome.I left this film with Christmas well and truly stolen!","

The art direction and graphics were really, really good. And you really felt that you were in a Dr. Suess movie.  I liked the part where they show the Grinch when he was little and explained why he hated Christmas... it wasn't a very convincing reason but it was still pretty good.  We went the night before to get tickets to see this movie and it was PACKED! All in all I can say don't go out of your way to see this movie, but if you get a chance to, sit down and watch it.  It was okay.  Although you can't compare it to the original Grinch, Jim Carrey did an awesome job.  I give this movie *** 1/2 out of *****","

","This was a good film, but it's darker than I expected. Not a lot of funny parts, even dark humor. What jokes there were went over the heads of the children in the theater. In fact, I can't recall a single time I heard children laugh at any of it. I'm sure one or two kids must have laughed once or twice, but I wouldn't bet on it. Jim Carrey was excellent. The idea that anybody athletic could have done the same job is idiotic. The good actor will almost always shine through the makeup and the costume, and he does. That said, though, he seemed hyperactive, compared to what I felt the Grinch was in the book. Maybe Ron Howard felt that constant activity would keep the kids in the audience entertained. That's a small point,though. I never met the Grinch, so maybe his take is the better one.I got the impression the good people of Whoville were played for idiots. I don't think that was what Howard intended, but their makeup and speech patterns and multi-colored sets made them look like fools. Would I want to spend five minutes in Whoville? Unlikely. Of course, they do change. There's a real change in the Whoville when they discover what the Grinch did to them as they slept. They become more human. Maybe another viewing would make it clear why they were set up for the fall like that. This is a loud film, too. That may just be the modern film disease, though. Most films are too loud these days. The crashes are louder, the gunfire, the slaps, the fistfights, the breaking bottles. All digitally diseased.I'd have no problem seeing the film again, but mainly to admire that anybody can put together a big film these days. It's easy to slice up Ron Howard when he doesn't tap our memories and deliver the perfect version of what we thought the Grinch meant to us. However, it's so hard to make movies these days, when somebody does something somewhat satisfying, I'm perhaps more thankful than most. I thought I got my money's worth.
If I have to select a single Christmas movie to watch every year, I don't expect Grinch will be it. My favorite will still be Christmas Story. Still, Grinch is okay.","

","The Grinch was boring and although they labored over the set, the outcome was unoriginal and unSeusslike.  The thing about Seuss books is that visually, although they are colorful, they are fairly minimal and surreal. The Grinch's set was so baroque and obvious.  Likewise with the language. Seuss's language is filled with bizarre ambiguities; this movie just pounded its flimsy anti-consumerism platitude into the ground.  The empty spaces and the made-up words in the books make it literature.  The movie just squeezed all of that out.  And the Grinch love interest aspect of it was beyond tired.","

","If I come out of a movie, especially if it was hyped as much as this, and I can only say 'eh, it's okay' then it's really not okay.The film itself is visually rich. Everything is detailed quite nicely and the special effects are tremendous. Ron Howard is a director who's work I generally enjoy immensly. He tells a story well and usually gets the best out of his actors. Then comes this. The Grinch. I'll admit that I was looking forward to seeing it. I like Jim Carrey, most of his film except for Man on the Moon, but I'll save that for that review. The acting is good, You really can't recognize Carrey under the makeup. And he plays the part to a tee.But it's the storyline that bugs me. Why does Hollywood feel the need to center a movie around a kid? And then make them sing? Why add so much new story to a classic? I found myself almost dozing off right in the middle of the film. This movie would have been more enjoyable if all the children had been tied down and gagged. I like kids in real life, but not on screen. It's what I call 'Dan Ackroyd syndrome'. The formula doesn't always need a kid. The Pepsi girl isn't cute!! But I'm subjected to her before every film, just like these films do. maybe I'm just going off on a tangent because the film just didn't grab me. But if you see it for yourself, you'll see what I mean. I'm not saying it was bad, it's just not great. If I want to watch a christmas film, I'll watch the Christmas Story, at least the kids in that are real. They have defined personalities. Go check the Grinch, but at the dollar theatre if you can.","

The original cartoon Grinch was a success because it stuck to the story and because Boris Karloff provided such a wonderful characterization.This film reminded me a LOT of Man in the Moon, which depended mostly on Carrey's over the top histrionics to carry the weak plot. This movie is the same way.  I found Carrey's performance in this movie a watered down version of his work in ""The Mask,"" and I totally agree with the reviewer that commented on Ron Howard stealing Tim Burton's visual look for this film. 
Why did they make this movie? In my opinion it's almost impossible to improve on the original, it's like someone trying to make a live-action remake of ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,"" invariably it disappoints, and I found the backstory of the Grinch's childhood an insulting sellout to Seuss' story.","

","Having seen the annual popular stage production at San Diego's Old Globe Theater I was thrilled that Theordore Suess Geisel's widow consented to making a live action feature.  The play was a gentle children's story that played on our memories of the TV production.  I enjoyed reading stories of Mrs. Geisel making trips to Hollywood to meet Ron Howard and her delight with some of his past films (I wonder which ones).  After seeing a sneak preview of this much more manic version I can honestly say that the decision was a good one.  Not only is the delightful costuming and make-up of the play well adapted to the screen, but Jim Carrey brings much depth to one of the most well-known Christmas characters.  Not since Boris Karloff's Frankenstein and Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera has so much been done under so much make-up.  No, we can't recognize him, but it's not just the make-up, the acting behind the mask is truely inspired.  Yes, that is the Grinch up there on the screen, no doubt about it.  Ron Howard is not an obvious choice of director having been more successful with slices of Americana (""Backdraft,"" ""Apollo 13"").  Even ""Cocoon"" and ""Splash"" were awash in American culture past and present.  Dr. Seuss has been part of most American childhoods for the past forty years.  Ron Howard was also a part of most American childhoods at the time the book was first published and the TV special came into our living rooms.  He certainly understands the mindset of those that grew up with the Grinch while understanding contemporary tastes. My only complaint is the lack luster narration provided by Sir Anthony Hopkins.  I remember when ""Twilight Zone the Movie"" was released and Rod Serling's narration was replaced with Zone favorite Burgess Meredith (inspired!).  Though it is difficult to replace Boris Karloff's classic (and yes, inspired!) narration (Vincent Price alas is dead too), couldn't Ron find someone with a creepier voice?  I guess the fact that Hopkins is best known for ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the connection to horror but, jeesh, Christopher Lee (an icon of 60's horror if there every was one) is the obvious choice!  If there is anyone who has a Boris Karloff sounding voice (with the Boris Karloff experience) it is Dracula Lee.  I understand that he is currently very popular (voicing the animated Rings trilogy and doing Lucas' Star Wars), but how long could the narration have taken???  Despite this complaint the film is still great fun.","

Say what you want but Ron Howard and most certainly Jim Carry should have never been a part of this project. Jim Carry over acts as he always does as the Grinch and Ron Howard just did not have the Director skills. The mountain in the animated story was so different and in Ron Howards version, it is a large pile of trash. Why? Why can't they ever stay true to the original story?

The whole point of the story is that Christmas (and the holiday season in general) is about more than flamboyant decorations and superficial gifts. It's about generosity, compassion, and kindness. I know it sounds corny, but I believe it and so did Dr. Suess. Yet, this movie made millions of dollars while saying in its script that money is not important.The charisma exhibited by the grinch in the book was not exhibited by the grinch in the movie. Cindy Lou Who became a type of ""good guy,"" constantly trying to edify the grinch. In the book, she is simply a symbol of innocence and childish wonder. That's already profound. She doesn't need to become a prostlytizer to proove anything. The simplicity of the Whos was also extracted from the movie. In the book, they had a wonderful appreciation of humility. In the movie, they, well, didn't. This holiday season, watch the animated movie version. Or, better yet, read the book to your kids. Dr. Suess was nice enough to share his extraordinary talent for writing children's literature with the world. Let's honor his memory by not changing his work.","

","This movie was just horrible.  I like the original ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" but this movie went incredible far off the original story. First off, the add-in about the Grinch's past were unneeded and the thing about him loving one of the whos was retarded.  Jim Carrey's performance as the evil Grinch was fair at best and the ending lacked the original's quality. This was a very bad film that does not deserve Dr. Suesses' name.","

","Opie's worst movie, and Carrey's least appealing performance since the Riddler.This movie has none of the magic, Xmas spirit, and abundant joy to found in Suess' book, or in the cartoon from the 60's.Yes, Ron has made clunkers before ( Grand Theft Auto, Willow ) but at least those films had some entertaining moments.  Grinch has none.  A stale, annoying, unimaginative unfunny miscalculation, on the order of past cinematic duds like Toys, Santa Claus:The Movie, and Howard the Duck.Jim Carrey and the screenwriters must share in the blame. Jim's antic schtick and one-liners fall deadly flat. And unlike Robin Williams' Genie from ""Alladin"", which was good fun and clever, Carrey's Grinch grows tiresome.What's most disappointing about Ron's movie ( and Carrey ) is that they commit the worst cinematic sin of all : they're boring.Add to that the most grating Xmas songs in recent memory.  James Horner seems to have channeled Barney the Dinosaur for inspiration.All the kiddies in the theatre seemed to share my view.  Half of them were constantly fidgiting from the start, or passed out asleep.
Parents, instead of the movie, read them the story, or rent the classic cartoon.  Merry Xmas  !!!!!","

","I had hope.  I love the Grinch, and while I had my doubts about a live-action version stretched out over four times the length of the original, I knew it could be done and I know Jim Carrey was passionate about this project...But it stunk.  I was with my father and my sister, who both adore the story as well, and even they came out disappointed.  Aside from how ridiculous it was having on of the most over-budgeted, over-advertised and over-merchandised film of the year try and preach about commercialism, it just didn't work in it's own right.  A lot of the film was just down right spooky (the grinch as a young schoolboy, an over-the-hill Christine Baranski's breasts being shoved in our faces constantly) - they essentially made an average Hollywood kids movie our of a classic story that deserves better.  Most of the movie is an entirely new story, with few redeeming moments, and when the real Grinch story finally begins, about an hour and ten minutes into the film, it had already exhausted my hopes and interest.
There were a few good moments. Jim Carrey's version of the ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch"" would be great if it wasn't trapped inside such a horrible movie.  But, during many parts, it seemed people around me were amused - even the millionth time they played the dog walking on it's hind legs for laughs.","

","Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Taylor Momsen, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon star in Ron Howard's 2000 fantasy based on the Dr. Seuss book and cartoon. This takes place in the town of Who-Ville where we meet The Grinch (Carrey) who despises Christmas since he was young. Soon, he meets young girl, Cindy Lou Who (Momsen) who tries to get him to share the holiday festivities with everyone in town. He decides to take Christmas away from the Whos, but fails when he eventually learns the true meaning of Christmas. Tambor (The Larry Sanders Show) plays the Mayor, Augustus MayWho, Baranski (The Birdcage) plays the Grinch's crush, Martha May Who, Irwin (My Blue Heaven) and Shannon (Never Been Kissed) play Cindy Lou's parents, Lou and Betty Lou. Howard's father Rance, brother, Clint and son, Jeremy also appear and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) narrates.

","Jim Carrey has done many great performances. From Count Olaf to The Riddler, Carrey actually gives his best performance as the Grinch. Jim Carrey is my favorite actor. I will see any film he's in, so it's no wonder I saw How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It tanked at with critics, but I must disagree. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, it's an awesome film. Jim Carrey is fantastic as The Grinch, and I couldn't believe how much I loved this film. Like How much I couldn't believe I loved A series of Unfortunate events. Carrey is evil in that film but I still liked his character. Sort of like with Ralph Feinnes in Harry Potter. His character is a bastard but I think he is pretty cool. It sounds like i'm supporting evil, but trust me, i'm not supporting evil. Somehow, everybody hated The Grinch. I was one of the rare few who loved this film. Directed by Ron Howard(Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon), I think The Grinch is great entertainment. It's actually one of my favorite Christmas films. How The Grinch stole Christmas is funny, has great visuals, and a great cast. There is such a big cast I don't know if I can name everyone. But i'll sure as hell try. Here is the cast to How the Grinch stole Christmas:Christine Baranski(Cybil, Mamma Mia!)Jeffery Tambor(Too many things)Molly Shannon(SNL, Superstar)Even Narrated by Anthony Hopkins(The Silence of the Lambs)How the Grinch stole Christmas is a great film. You can sue me I don't care. I know everyone hated this film, but i'm one of the rare few who loved it. Definitely Dr. Seuss's best film adaptation and i'm proud of it. I actually prefer the film to the book, and that's saying quite a lot. I loved How the Grinch stole Christmas, and I think you should see it.The Plot:The Grinch, who was bullied as a child, hates Christmas. He happens to live above a town that celebrates Christmas all the time. So when Cindy Lou Who decides to get The Grinch to come down, he hates Christmas even more. He decides to take all of the town's presents for revenge.","

This movie is one of my all-time favourite movies ever. I really love Christmas movies (my other favourite is Nightmare Before Christmas), unfortunately, not every single Xmas movie is good. This one is more than good. The characters and the plot line is so silly and adorable, it creates an atmosphere for which I can't say 'No'. The backgrounds, the special effects, the make-ups and especially Whoville is so precisely created that I simply can't believe it. And the most important of all...JIM CARREY! He was born for this role, he acts like he has always been the Grinch. I really like Max too, he puts an interesting twist into the movie, because he is the only animal (Okay, and the white cat, who becomes stolen by the Grinch). There is only one character I hate, that's the Mayor, but I think it's because he is on the 'evil side'. :)Trust me, this is a really good movie!","

","This is an absolutely wonderful movie. I remember upon first hearing that Ron Howard was taking the Dr. Seuss book and creating it into a full-length feature I was shocked. Wondering how this could be done and thinking what a disappointment it would be. In reality how could you take such a wild story and cast it to remain true to the children's book which I love. After seeing the movie I was truly astounded at the awesome quality and I know that no one other than Jim Carey could have actually pulled off the role of the Grinch. As to all those who have rated this movie so mediocre and have called in overdone and blown out of proportion. I think perhaps they have lost their perspective in that the whole Dr. Seuss book is ""bigger and more imaginative than life itself"". To have produced this movie as a more ""down to earth, layed back and not overblown style"" would have been the tragedy. This movie is a joy to anyone who has never lost their childhood wonder and spirit of Christmas. If you don't love this movie I would ask myself, ""Where are you Christmas"". Fantastic Movie full of holiday cheer and the meaning of Christmas.","

","When I was a child, I wasn't fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to watch this classic cartoon as it just wasn't a tradition as it is in the U.S. to view this every Christmas time and so I only got to watch this as an adult while I was studying in your fine country and yet I was blown away. I had read Seuss as a child in the public libraries but this was the first time I had a chance to see the animated versions. The picture quality has been restored very well here on this DVD however the sound quality while is good at Dolby Digital Stereo quality is not remastered well enough coming without any DTS with THX or Dolby 5.1 option although whose of you with Pro Logic would have it a little better. This becomes apparent especially for the second great feature: ""Horton Hears a Who"" where the volume levels alternate from just right to too soft at various points of the cartoon. The special features here are very, very good with documentaries featuring great interviews with the voice talents and the composer Albert Hague who wrote the great music for the songs on the Grinch. Overall, this is a very good DVD of great value for money and I can only anticipate what a better restored version with enhanced sound quality perhaps on Blu-ray would look like and I await such a DVD with bated breath. In the meantime though, this DVD is still a very good tribute to that great classic, the original and still the best version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" Highly recommended.","

While the people of Whoville look forward to celebration and festivities, the Grinch plans to steal all the presents and spoil it for everyone.I have to say that Jim Carrey captures the character with great precision and brings his usual comedy capers to screen once again. It's a good job that he did, because this film stretches Dr Zeus's story out too long, leaving it feeling a bit dull at times; some of the additional background behind the Grinch was interesting, but this film could definitely have been trimmed down to around 80 Min's.6/10 It's fun and Carrey is brilliant, but it's not great","

I do think that the earlier Chuck Jones version is a classic in its own right and I enjoy it as well. I don't think one can fairly compare the two versions; this version has a much more involved back story which explains the Grinch's motivation, while Jones' version is much more taut due to its lesser running time.I found this to be visually very attractive, with excellent computer animation and an awesome job by the artistic director. There's a lot of boffo humor in this version as well with inside jokes galore. I'm mixed in my opinion of Jim Carrey in general, but this is definitely one of his best performances.

Maybe that is the key - the film has grown on me. But, maybe not.

If you do, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it. Jim Carrey is unbelievably hilarious as the grumpy Grinch, his physical performance, vocal performance and facial expressions are out of this world, along with the excellent lines he has; ""6 o'clock? Dinner with me, and I can't cancel that again!"" Even the angelic 6-year-old girl is hilarious (and actually cute, not irritating) as the most mature character in town, ""Dad, don't you find Christmas a bit superfluous?"", who brings the Grinch back to town for the hilarious montage of Who-bilation events.The film is incredibly cheesy and emotional, but in an amazing way! The shocking Faith Hill song is entirely brilliant for its terribleness: ""Where are you Christmas/Why have you gone away?"" Eh?! (Then again, it is co-written by Mariah Carey, so.....) But its Jim Carrey that makes the film so numerously re-watchable as you'll notice more and more side-splitting things with every time.

","This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen in my life. Jim Carrey has that rare talent to do hardly anything at all, and make you crack up. He excels in this movie at doing that.For those who hated this movie, I have 2 things to say. Firstly, if you are some kind of Christmas movie purist who wanted this movie to be like the old animated movie, why did you go to this movie?!?! You knew it wasn't going to be that way because Jim Carrey is in it. Secondly, if you don't like Jim Carrey, don't see this movie, because he is the main star and about 98% of the funny things in this movie is him doing something zany. I'd like to see the original screenplay of this film and see how much Jim Carrey actually said in it and how much he just made up on the spot because I don't think Ron Howard would have been like ""oh, you should definitely bite this wine bottle"". It's those kind of things that makes this movie so hilarious though.One thing that no one can deny is the excellence of the production. The costumes and make-up are completely original and the set design insanely seusslike. If Dr. Seuss saw this movie and hated it (which i wouldn't deny would happen), he'd still adore the Whoville set and everything. It is awesome.I have such a good time watching this movie and sometimes I don't wait until the holiday season to watch this. And after seeing it who knows how many times, I still laugh at Jim Carrey's funny antics as the Grinch. At times is performance is reminiscent of his Tony Clifton in Man on the Moon. He talks with his gut sticking out and his lips projected to the side.This movie is the perfect way to get into the holiday spirit or just to have a good laugh. Like the book and original cartoon or not, there's no denying that the real purpose of this movie was to entertain and not to copy. Given that the movie is much longer than the half hour original, you should probably figure out that it's not supposed to be exactly like it, and should therefore stop trying to compare them.","

","This is the very good adaption of Dr. Seuss' classic Christmas story about the green pest who hated Christmas. The Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, and everyone is excited and happy about it, except for the Grinch (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey) at the top of a mountain. When little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) becomes curious of the Grinch, she wanders up to his lair and temps him to come down to Whoville to be the holiday Cheer Meister instead of the Mayor (Jeffrey Tambor), and in front of the woman that used to have a soft spot for him, Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski). But it isn't long before the Grinch is haunted by his childhood past and he turns nastier. So he finally decides that to stop Christmas from coming, he'll steal it! So he steals all the presents, the decorations, the food, everything Christmassy. In the end he learns that Christmas means more than all of that and turns nice, a nice ending. Also starring Bill Irwin as Lou Lou Who, Molly Shannon as Betty Lou Who, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Whobris, Austin Powers' Mindy Sterling as Clarnella and narrated by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Filled with hilarious gags and good green make-up, director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer have done a great job. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair.

","I am totally embarrassed to have actually spent money to see this in the theater. With that said, I am shameful to admit having sat through it. Looks like I have nothing better to do at the moment than critique a movie most people have seen already. A horrible adaptation to the classic book I loved as a kid. It was Carrey mugging through the whole film. Carrey is a funny guy, but this was just overdone and lame. I got sick of his antics after 20 minutes. If they would have stuck within the limits of the book and done a half hour show it would have been better. Seeing stupid additional crap was blasphemy, who cares how the Grinch was as a kid. That stuff is better left unsaid. Why are people obsessed with having to know the entire background of a famous villain (Darth Vader, etc) rather than leave it in a shroud of mystery.The only thing that's worse than this movie is the soundtrack. Poorly made up songs with stupid lyrics. I wouldn't even let a 5-year old listen to it for fear of corrupting the poor child with stupidity. Stick to the cartoon and book, which are timeless classics.Most kids love this movie (do they know any better? They also love today's sorry cartoons) most adults and anyone with a full developed brain will hate it. I liken it to sitting in a room for 2 hours with Jar Jar Binks. You'd feel like strangling Carrey's Grinch!","

","Originally, in 2000, for some reason I liked this movie. Now, 2003, thinking on it I finally realized how terrible this movie is.  The moral of the story is that it doesn't matter how much you SPEND on Christmas, its the thought that counts and yet this was a very commercial movie with tons of advertising and a huge budget. It doesn't make much sense.  This is kind of a slap in the face to Dr. Seuss and please just do yourself a favor and stick to the original cartoon- or the book.Thanks. 4/10","

","Somehow, i also found How the Grinch Stole Christmas to be a delight when the cartoon was on. I did. Then when the movie came out, I was more surprised how the live action version looked more elogant and rich with the special effects. Jim Carrey stole the show as the grinch, a crumudgeon who lives on Mt. Crumpit and loaths the spirit of Christmas all because he was abandon as a child. What made the movie interesting to watch was that there was a background behind the character, a whole new revoultion towards the grinch which made the film wonderful. I would recommand this film to anybody that loves Dr. Seuss. I would also say that this is superior than the cat in the hat which anybody can see this film overs and overs again.10/10","

","This was the worst movie I have ever seen.  Unfunny, no sympathetic characters, bad story line. You name it, this movie lacked it.  For the first time in my life I nearly decided to leave the theater. But I decided to stay and stick it out.  It only got worse, so I decided to take a nap, but I refused because i paid my $6.00 matinee waste of money.  All of that and I was only 1/2 way through this turgid pile of crud.  Unfortunately, I stayed awake.  The nap would have been worth closer to the 6 bucks than the last hour of this movie. The one thing that might have rescued this movie is if the whole of Whoville and all the snotty Whos were bombed into oblivion by the Burger Meister Meisterburger.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was that Cindy Lou Who was cute; old, but cute.  I recommend this movie for use as an interrogation tool for the CIA.","

","I'm sorry but this film is not a good adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book.  I don't think director Ron Howard understands the bizarre worlds which Dr. Seuss created.  Of course, the production designers made the set look close enough to the world Seuss created in his books but the film turns into yet another would-be fantasy which doesn't take the weirdness into consideration besides the set.  Jim Carrey turns in a performance that's just inappropriate for the Grinch or even the books.  In fact, the Grinch in this film looks nothing like the Grinch in the books.  He looks more like a mouse than a Grinch.  I'm telling you, hire Tim Burton to make every live-action adaptation of Dr. Seuss's books and everything will be just fine.","

","When I first heard about this movie, I thought, ""BAD IDEA"", since I grew up with ""Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and didn't want a good thing to be ruined.  When I found out that Ron Howard was going to direct and Jim Carrey was going to star I was ecstatic, but still skeptical.  Even when I saw the previews I was a bit leery.I must say that the movie was excellent!!!  Jim Carrey plays the perfect Grinch and Ron Howard directed a beautiful movie.  There are a few times where the camera-work was a bit odd, but nothing I couldn't deal with. Also, the humor was excellent, because some of it was obviously for the adult audience and some of it was for the child audience...and there was plenty of both to keep you laughing throughout the film.  Anthony Hopkins was an added bonus to the film.  He narrated the film with his excellent voice.  The rest of the cast was good as well; Jeffery Tambor, Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon (who I'm usually not a fan of), and Clint Howard.  I also have to mention Taylor Momsen, she was the perfect choice for the role of Cindy Lou Who, and quite a fine little actress.Overall, I thought this was an excellent cartoon-to-live-action film adaption and was quite entertaining.  I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes the original animated film and/or is a fan or Ron Howard or Jim Carrey.  I hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris","

","Growing up, I stayed away from How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  It was not one of my favorites.  I found it rather boring and silly.  Therefore, when Jim Carrey did the Grinch, especially after seeing how it was advertised, I stayed away from it. It was inevitable that I should come back and watch it at a much later date since I am a Jim Carrey fan.  I found it to be done excellently.  Jim did a great job at portraying the Grinch, and for the first time, I found myself liking the story.  He made it believable, and he actually makes you feel sorry for the Grinch.  After all, he was mistreated; it is a wonder that he was not worse off than he was.  Being on his own for so long, it is also surprising that he was not a total, stark-raving, mad lunatic and that he did not do much worse to the town. My other favorite characters, who did not receive enough credit, were Max, the dog, and Cindy Lou Who who also made the day.  They both made the movie.  I highly recommend this movie, not especially to kids because kids could not quite comprehend a lot of the things in it, but most especially to teens and adults.  Even if you say ""Bah Humbug!"" to Christmas, you will still like this little jewel!  Jim pulled it through and saved an otherwise bad story and made it a great story yet again!","

","First of all, I would like to say that I love Doctor Seuss, Ron Howard's films, and the stylistic acting of Jim Carrey.  Not even the three of them combined could make up for this film.The original Grinch is a classic.  No other word for it.  It stays true to the original Dr. Seuss story, and was very well done, from the animation to the performance of Boris Karloff.  Best Christmas special ever.  And, of course, when I went to this movie, I knew they would have to add a few things and elongate the story to turn this into a 90 minute + movie.  Fine. But I expected a lot better than what was presented to me as a viewer.I honestly can't find more than one good thing about this movie.  The special effects were lousy, the music was forgettable, and the sets were obviously cardboard.  Even the performance by Jim Carrey, hailed by many, was bad.  I don't see the Grinch as being eccentric, I see a grouch with no sense of humor, which is the exact opposite of what Jim gave.  Not only was his performance TOO over-the-top, the script was generally dull and boring. As you can imagine, I left the theater with a disposition that would make the Grinch look like a puppy in comparison.  I was also angered at the thought that thousands of children will be exposed to THIS Grinch before they see the original.And the original story was ripped to shreds.  The Whos are portrayed as being selfish and greedy.  They aren't in the Christmas spirit, they just want to outdo each other with decorations and presents.  Totally against the spirit of the book.  Dr. Seuss must be spinning in his grave.  Too much was added, in fact, so much was added, by the time they got to the main story, there was only 20 minutes left in the movie.  Then, they had to cram the rest of the story in, giving little credit to the actual story of the Grinch and his plot to ""steal"" Christmas.  There was little stealing, here.All in all, one of the worst, for everyone involved.  I don't think I'm being to hard on this movie, because it deserved it.  Maybe I should watch it again to see if I just didn't get it.  Yeah.  Or I could shoot myself in the foot. /**********     (0/10 stars)","

","""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a Christmas classic that usually receives repeated viewings in my household. The Grinch is a timeless tale of tolerance, discised as a fantasy. It's the perfect way to put your Little Cindy Lou Who to bed on Christmas Eve, or any night of the year. ""Hurton Hears A Who"" is another delightful story, which will be especially popular with animal lovers. The animated adaptations of these two stories are a ""hateful"" of fun! Here's more on each of the shorts, because a person is a person no matter how small and you deserve some good protect information. You can keep your Frosty the Snowman, Rudoplh the Red Nosed Reindeer, and all the rest. Just let me have my Grinch. Quite simply, this is the best movie that money can buy- a wonderful gift and you never can have too many Grinch movies. Any family should own this movie. After all, who can resist this tale of selfishness conquered by love? Not me, that's for sure. I'm not really into seeing the Jim Carrey version; nothing can top this Dr. Seuss masterpiece. Not even Hollywood. The Grinch is a mean one, and your kids will think YOU'RE mean if you don't stuff their stocking with this. It's collectively a perfect disc, and kids will be excited to hear that the soundtracks to both films appear unabridged on a single disc. This is a very special DVD release sure to satisfy the ones who aren't getting a lump of coal this year....","

","How The Grinch Stole ChristmasAfter walking out of this feature the only thing one remembers and discusses about is Jim Carrey and his excellent performance in it since beyond that it doesn't have anything to offer. How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a reasonable childish feature that fulfills and checks off each and every fantasy of a five year old kid but forgets to offer anything more than that in order to satisfy it and hence restraints itself to go bold. Ron Howard is disappointingly not in its A game resulting into some poor execution, amateur editing and loosely placed sequences. As mentioned earlier, its a Jim Carrey's show and he has a lot to offer in here, with amazing skill and perfect comic timing he demands attention from the viewers. How The Grinch Stole Christmas has some one liners, cliched comic sequences and petty writing that miraculously comes alive and helps survive it by stellar performance.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3605457/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw3605457,8," A great feel good Christmas film
","It's Christmas day tomorrow so me and my family decided to watch how the Grinch stole Christmas and this is a great Christmas film. The Premise of the film sees a land of whoville trying to celebrate Christmas when a Grinch decides to ruin Christmas. Jim carrey plays the Grinch in this film and he truly owns the role in this film, he is in allot of makeup but it shows in his great physically hilarious performance that is hard not to enjoy. He is very charismatic and you can tell that he improvised allot of his lines and is having fun which is great to see. The little girl in the film is good and gives a performance that works well with the grinch an you understand how their relationship progresses. Jeffrey tambor gives a fun performance as the mayor of whoville and he is good as the annoying antagonist in the film. Unfortunately, there are other characters that are just pretty dull and you don't really care about some of the who's. The story has some really good drama in it and you actually see great character progression from the Grinch. You end up caring about his story arc and you like seeing his character grow. The script has so much great dialogue, so much humour from the Grinch but also drama and depth to the great message in the film. The style is really unique with some absolutely amazing make up and costume designs that is award worthy. However, some of the effects are very dated an they just really take you out of the film. Overall this is a great Christmas film that has a great message that the whole family can enjoy.","

","If you are trying to be a film nerd, just stop. Imagine you never saw the cartoon. The acting is excellent, makeup is fantastic, costumes are true to the book, and props are world class. Sure, we all have preferences, but Ron Howard brought it all together as always. For those who say there is not enough time to appreciate the details, I say bull- honky. 16 years later, I am laughing at props and gags that are not the focus of the scene. We still enjoy it as separate but related to the cartoon (which only I appreciate in my family). Anyway, relax, rent it or pop it in, and have fun. Don't take yourself too seriously. This is easily a 10/10. By the way, wine helps if you are a parent.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2533088/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw2533088,4," Another horrible Seuss adaptation
","""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a timeless classic. A simple story about a grumpy green creature who hatches a plan to torment the simple denizens of ""Whoville"" by literally stealing Christmas only to achieve a heartwarming epiphany in the end. It's a great children's book and the 1966 film captures the spirit of Dr. Seuss perfectly.The 2000 live adaptation on the other hand doesn't come close one bit.It is one of the more unpleasant and mean spirited movies that I have seen and since this is an adaptation of a holiday classic, the mean-spiritedness really stands out.What do I mean? The Whos are absolutely horrible! Materialistic, ugly both physically and morally, their unpleasantness is made more prominent by the rather smudged cameras (well they seem smudged anyway) and the scenery that could be described as ""polluted"". Oh and the numerous adult themed jokes that do nothing but make everyone uncomfortable.Jim Carrey tries hard as the Grinch which is unfortunately a problem as he continually goes over the top and swallows the scenery at every turn. He sadly makes up the high point of the movie.Overall, to the film's credit...it's not the worst Seuss adaptation out there and whatever dark forces were at work controlling Ron Howard, they seemed to be excised. But yeah, get the 1966 cartoon and pretend this movie never happened.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2531045/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw2531045,6," How Ron Howard Stole the Grinch
","How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a film adaptation of the always memorable 1957 book by Dr. Seuss. The story was already adapted into the classic 1966 television special featuring Boris Karloff the Uncanny. How does it hold up compared to these and other Christmas movies? Not particularly well.To say something nice first, the film looks great. If ever you wanted to see a Dr. Seuss book come to life, this is it. The set design is terrific. The blend of miniatures and computer generated imagery is fantastic to the point where stuff looks very convincing. The make-up effects were good enough to win an Oscar.Jim Carrey does a great job. He obviously is having fun with the role, getting to play as over the top as he wants. His usual silly improvisation works well with the role. He also does very well in the make-up, able to perform many facial expressions that don't look real. That one iconic grin appearing to be digitally enhanced, though it wasn't. And once the movie gets to the book/special parts where the Grinch is actually stealing Christmas, Carrey shines and makes the movie incredibly fun.The rest of the cast is okay. They are all overplayed bordering on camp, but I guess that was what Ron Howard was going for. Taylor Momsen does a decent job in her first starring role, but Cindy Lou is portrayed as far too over-the-top sweet. Every scene she's in seems to punch you in the face with how sweet she is and how cute she looks. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as the narrator, but he's got such a good voice he could make the phone book sound interesting. This is about where the good stuff ends.The TV special had directly adapted the book, so to turn it into a full length feature extra content had to be added. Some is welcome, most is not. I do like how they expanded on the relationship between the Grinch and Whoville since the original story did not have much. The concept of why the Grinch hates Christmas is good in theory but the way it was done was lousy. The whole ""Made fun of as a kid"" thing has been done dozens of times before and doesn't help the original story's true message (more on that later). The entire Whobilation sequence is dumb, tedious, and seems to exist only to fill up space. Howard had some fun and Carrey got to be silly but it hardly helps the plot in anyway. You can skip past it and not miss anything.Ron Howard is mostly known for his dramatic movies. Backdraft, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, and even Parenthood was more of a dramatic movie with comedic elements. And he seems out of his element by doing this campy, silly style. He would have done better with a dramedy like Parenthood. But this just isn't his style and it shows. Other directors can pull off camp with style but Howard, like Spielberg, is better suited for drama with comedy added.The biggest problem with the movie is that it completely reverses the message of the original story. Originally, the Grinch didn't understand the true meaning of Christmas and it was the Whos who made him see the truth. In this movie, the Whos are over-commercialized gluttons who only care about material things and it is Grinch who makes them see the truth. What? Did the producers ever even read the book or watch the special? Didn't anyone involved ever say, ""Hey, you got this backwards.""? The reason the Grinch is a grinch is supposed to be because he just sees the material things and thinks that's all there is. Later, he realizes that stuff was only a representation of feelings. Here the Whos are all self-centered jerks, except for overly sweet Cindy Lou, who represent all the negative things about the Christmas season until the finale. As with any adaptation, fans will tolerate any change as long as the spirit stays true to the source. But this movie was not faithful to what Seuss was trying to say. If the movie had just stuck to the original story and just expanded on Grinch's misconceptions about the season, the movie would have done very well. After all, he's supposed to be the hero and villain whereas here he is simply this green goofball doing random things up until he actually performs the title deed.Children will probably enjoy the silly antics and goofy setting. Though my little brother (who was three when the movie came out but I don't remember when he did see it) was terrified of the Grinch for years after seeing the movie because Carrey can be intense for the younger ones. Adults will probably find the story to be dumb and full of fluff. Fans will enjoy how Carrey performs the role but may find the story to be too drastically changed. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, there's plenty better about finding the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the classic TV special is readily available wherever this movie is sold.","

","Yeah, I think that the makeup and the art direction is enough for a person to watch. Even if you have serious, very serious, reservations about Jim Carrey in this, and even if you feel that Ron Howard just didn't show the skill that he did in Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, or The DaVinci Code, you can admire the technical knowhow. The biggest difficulty for me personally is that I kept wishing I was watching the Chuck Jones animation and hearing Boris Karloff's narration instead. It is a shame, in my elfish opinion, that Ron Howard felt it necessary to include vulgarisms, but we all know that G rating isn't supposed to sell as well as the PG rating. I believe a little research throws that assumption out the window when average box office figures for G rated movies are compared to those for those with ""more mature"" ratings. One other disturbing factor to me was that this film didn't come through as well with the theme of Christmas being more than receiving (and even giving) material gifts. I do believe that this is a good enough film to include in your Christmas viewing, but do compare it with the earlier cartoon version.","

Lots of work have been poured over this film, and you feel that every little detail have been under the looking glass. The plot is and old-timer, but never the less, it is secondary. Just enjoy the figures and the tone, and let your self be driven in to a fantastic fantasy world.

","Although this may be one of his weaker movies, Jim Carrey still manages to impress. Just like most of his flicks, 'How the Grinch stole Christmas' is obviously a one-man-show. As expected, Carrey doesn't disappoint. The big question is, why only 7/10. Well it has got a cute story and very nice settings and make-up, but like I said, the only thing about the movie that's really good, is Carrey himself. He makes the rest of the cast look very poor. I know it's a film made for kids, but when it involves Carrey I always tend to take a look. He has proved that he's up to a lot more than this (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Truman Show). When you see this with Christmas, it delivers, but you can't take this too seriously the other 363 days of the year.5 points for Carrey, 2 for the rest!","

","The Cartoon feature of How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a classic. In fact it is one of my favorite Christmas cartoons even after all of these years. Ron Howard took the Grinch classic and turned it upside down and ruined it. This movie has the Grinch and Cindylou Who being the only two characters who feel the holiday should be about more, where in the original, the only one who didn't get the concept of Christmas was the Grinch. Talk about changing a story around. Howard, normally a fine director changed the whole concept of the story  and gave us the typical Horrorweird cliche ridden crap where only one person isn't into the commercialism of Christmas and pretty much everybody else is. I've seen this on everything from the Bob Hope specials to the made for t.v. crap that comes out at the holidays. It's been done too many times and is beginning to sound way too preachy for me.It is way too old of a story line.On top of that, Howard throws in a love interest and a political rival. Instead of a classic, we are given a seasick crocadile of a film. Having said that, the only redeaming thing about this movie other than the effects, make-up, and costumes is the performance of Jim Carrey, He pulled off the Grinch excellently. Much too good for this movie. Can you imagine if they had stuck to the original premise of the movie? It would have been great! Instead we get this. You're a mean one Mr. Howard. especially on this. You gave us a film of unwashed socks and a rotten banana with a greasy black peal! Yuck!!!!P.U.!!!!!","

","All the glitter and tinsel and goo in the world can't save this film from its obvious flaws. I was very disappointed on Christmas Eve at how surprisingly dull and un-inventive this one was. The directing is loathably shoddy. A very poor attempt by Academy Award Winner Ron Howard. Jim Carrey was attempting to be witty and clever as the Grinch but just came off as being annoying and a thorn in the side. To be fair, the sets were inventive and the costumes were simply dazzling. But this can't make up for the film's downfalls. Any trace of humour feels forced and harvested and doesn't flow naturally. Stick with the more traditional Christmas movies such as Home Alone and The Muppet Christmas Carol this year, but avoid this cheap plastic throwaway. 4 out of 10.","

","Beyond the use of too much back story, beyond the decision to jam every bit of design and gimmicks possible into the film so that it is rendered unwatchable, beyond the ludicrous, over-the-top performance to the point that Carrey reminds me of Dr. Frank N. Furter wrapped in a green carpet, the filmmakers completely missed the point of the story. A previous poster said it best: Geisel wanted to give us a character who just happens to be rotten, period. His redemption in the book and cartoon are far greater events because he finds the love in himself to vanquish HIS evil nature which is HIS ALONE. Additionally, the film seems to work overtime to secularize the story, which Geisel didn't try to do.Read the book and see the cartoon, which is a truly uplifting experience. Avoid this load of green-and-red cotton candy.","

","I originally saw this film when it came out on video in 2001, and I was very disappointed.  But I couldn't figure out why.  Initially I thought it was just that old nagging nostalgia that plagues us all.  But I am not a huge fan of animated film, so this didn't seem to fit since I never really liked the cartoon version that well in the first place.  It hit me while watching the 1951 version of ""Scrooge"" starring Alastair Sim.  This version has little redemption!The back story created to fill time in this version ends up (possibly unintentionally) blaming the Whos for the Grinch's general grouchiness and meanness.  But deep inside we all want a truly evil creature (someone evil for no particular reason) to be redeemable.  It helps us feel that we are also redeemable.  This version of the story takes the typical Western ""politically correct"" position that no one is bad for no particular reason--that someone besides the perpetrator is responsible for the actions of the perpetrator.  But even Dr. Seuss seems to think that some people are bad for no particular reason as evidenced by the original version.Christmas is a time for redemption.  The whole reason for the celebration is the redemption of mankind.  And deep inside we all know that we need to be redeemed, even if we aren't as bad as the Grinch.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594453/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594453,3," How Hollywood Ruins Classics
","There is so much wrong with the Grinch...but primarily it's just boring and unnecessary and that is the main feeling that kept coming up while I was sitting in the theater, watching this expensive experiment, waiting for it to find a point or direction. Did it want to be funny? Yes, most certainly so. Was it? It was about as funny as it looks, which is to say...not very funny...unless Jim Carrey squeezing everything he can out of a seriously not funny script...is funny. Whose brilliant idea was it to use a script penned by a team whose last effort yielded the disaster that is Wild Wild West? Come on. If you start with a bad script, which this definitely is, when do you ever get good movie? Seems like they purposely didn't write any jokes, figuring Jim Carrey would just improvise....It doesn't work well...actually not at all. One or two laughs...okay maybe three or four...But they aren't big ones. Howard stretches and stretches and stretches the story out....like it needed to be 1 hour 45 min. How about 1 hour 15...it could of been a nice short well paced movie and that was what you were hoping for the whole time. Unfortunately, the movie suffers the most from being just plain boring....everything good is buried under bad filler. The best parts are when it takes literally from the book...with Anthony Hopkins's narration and Jim Carrey's responses...although they never use it to it's full potential and it's too little too late. Another problem is the Whos...they're just obnoxious...you want the Grinch to ruin it for them. You want him to eat a couple maybe! You want someone to smack them in their ignorant and not so wholesome heads! Also there is this stupid subplot about what is Christmas...is it commercialism?...Hypocritical trash coming from a movie who has more tie-ins than most movies this year. Other questions that come up while watching (not after), which is a really bad sign:Why is the Grinch talking like that? Why is the Grinch manic?Why isn't the dog funnier?Why isn't the Grinch funnier?Why do the whos look like that? Why are they so annoying? Why does it look like they stole the Flinstones' set?Why is my foot itching? Am I still watching this? Is it over?I wonder how much this cost? Why is Molly Shannon in this? Why isn't she funny? Why oh why did they do this? Really so many other directions could of been taken and they chose no real direction at all. They touched on some. They teased you a bit but never followed any good ideas through. Well maybe half-ass spastic zannyness...they followed that through in spades, which was not what Dr. Suess was ever about. Suess seemed to be about dignified fantasy based on very real morals. Not Jim Carrey playing a bipolar fur ball, in Universal backlot heaven. Which leads to production design. The production design teeters between really good and god-awful. Whoville being a backlot seems to take most of the blame. The only winner here is Rick Baker's makeup...which sometimes is downright scary...it carries the movie.  Ron Howard really needs to find his own personality. He is always imitating someone else. First Spielberg with Backdraft, then Cameron with Apollo, and now Burton with this.  Should of left it alone. A story you all know and loved done perfectly as a cartoon which is probably why you'll spend the whole time picturing the cartoon and that great curly Chuck Jones smile that they gave the Grinch and of course the unforgetable voice of Karloff. Stop messing with stories we all love. Try thinking up something more original. If you want to pay tribute or homage to the stories you love, follow Burton's cue with Nightmare Before Christmas. A very original tribute to the stop-motion holiday specials...and look he didn't have to ruin a classic did he.Although Burton himself seems to be losing track of this idea. Sleepy Hollow... and now Planet of the Apes.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594447/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594447,5," Stunning visually; overlong; insincere in its message
","Wow. Whoville lives. It sure looks like Whoville, and Jim Carrey sure looks like the Grinch, and the Whos look more like Whos than anybody could. The look, the atmosphere, the visuals are excellent. Can't complain about that.It's a tad overpadded, though. It starts to drag a bit and the major-league test of movie interest failed; that is, I looked at my watch during the film.Jim Carrey does a fine Grinch, but unlike most of the reviewers here, don't believe that Carrey is the guy who had to play this role; any decently physical actor could have done it. All he had to do was be relatively animated and convincingly emotional. In fact, post-production work sped up the body movements in many scenes to look cartoonish, so Carrey didn't really have to look cartoonish while he was acting. He was great, but they probably didn't need to get a guy who wanted a Carrey-sized paycheck.What spoiled it for me was the message. The story really made a point about the overcommercialization of Christmas that is both true and is not approached enough in film. The problem is that this movie is going to be sold through Happy Meals and toys galore just in time for the Christmas season, which is sort of sickening. It's about as hypocritical as you can get.I gave it a 5/10. Not a waste of money, but you could go see something else and get more entertainment, even if you are a kid.Finally, I didn't need to see a guy kissing a dog's rump, or the dog wiping its rump on the carpet, or any wife-swapping jokes. That content is just stupid (and disgusting in the kissing part) and doesn't belong in a Dr. Seuss picture aimed at kids. No wonder his widow disavowed this picture after seeing it.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594417/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594417,8," A Fun Holiday Movie For 2000.
","I've been reading the comments on ""The Grinch"", and I have to say that they seem a little harsh.  In fact, I even think I saw a review saying this was comparable to ""Batman & Robin"".  No, no, no.  Nothing could ever compare to that mockery of a movie (but several have tried), and while ""Grinch"" has a few little nitpicks, it's certainly not a bad movie.The story itself is all too familiar, but now it has a lot of backstory and exposition and everything else.  Initially, it sags a little at times, but immediately picks right back up before ever really dropping the ball, and as it gets closer to the Grinch's stealing of Christmas, it really picks up and doesn't stop from there.  But you have to look at this objectively: It's a children's story with whimsical characters, so it gets silly at times, and overall, that's fine.  What I didn't like were the camera speed up/slow down effects.  *MINOR spoiler* There's a scene where the Grinch is driving a miniature car, and after he wrecks it, has to escape before it explodes.  This escape is done in slow motion, and this totally just seemed to say ""Hey!  This is a big budget Hollywood film! Explosions are practically mandatory!""  But then again, this isn't exactly ""Die Hard"" either. It does the same effect later for another scene, and it still bugged me.  *End minor spoiler*
I think the film could also have gone without the references to current trends, jokes and happenings.  I think it would have kept more of a timeless quality that way.  But it was still a fun ride.The sets were great.  During a visit to Universal, I had a chance to see these sets up close, and they looked the way they should, and translated even better to film.  While Tim Burton would probably have done a fantastic job with this, the sets were appropriately Seuss regardless.  Colorful, weird, and imaginative all the way.I've noticed some people saying that Jim Carrey was wrong for the Grinch. As his third green cartoon character (Mask and The Riddler being the other two), he was back to the Jim Carrey of 5 years ago: Totally offbeat and just nuts.  And it was nice to see him briefly return to that again, and it shows that he's pretty comfortable with both his comedy and drama roles.  But something happens to Carrey as he begins to steal Christmas: He completely transforms into the Grinch, right down to the posturing, facial expressions and dialogue from the cartoon.  The gradual change was a complete shock to me, and it left no doubt in my mind that he was more than perfect for the role.  The costume looked great and it turned out to be more effective than I thought.The little girl who played Cindy Lou was pleasant for the role (proving that not all child actors are annoying), and her interaction with the Grinch was fun.  Anthony Hopkins was fine as the Narrator, and while Boris Karloff made a great Grinch/ Narrator in the original cartoon, the man passed away over 30 years ago.  There's really not much that can be done about that.  Even the dog was entertaining.
The music?  I always like a good James Horner score (barring the over-played ""Titanic"" theme, and they even fit the songs in from the cartoon, so there's no disappointment there.So ""The Grinch"" got a little too silly for itself at times, but The Grinch himself was good, the sets were amazing, the adapted parts from the book and cartoon were surreally accurate, it had a decent message, and the narration even had Seuss-style rhyme.  It's a film that you can take the kids to, or just sit back and enjoy all the eye-candy.  You might even find some nostalgia in there as well.  If you look at it that way, then there's really nothing to complain about.","

","This movie's budget of $115 million dollars was primarily spent on lavish and exotic sets, incredible make-up, special effects and wonderful props. Of course, I am sure that Jim Carrey got his cut too.But it just proves that throwing big money around does not make a good film.Director Ron Howard has taken the delightful 26-minute children's Christmas fable by Dr. Seuss and padded it, overblown it and turned it into an over-long mish-mash of effects with little-to-none of the heart and soul of the original.  It was also definitely not directed for children  but for their parents.  It also has the biggest make-up crew of any film I have ever seen.This movie does exactly what the cautionary story by Dr. Suess warns about: Christmas is not in the trappings and money spent  it is in the heart  and this movie lacks any heart whatsoever.The sound editing was near perfect; however, the best songs come after the audience has left the theater.  If you are going to see this movie sit and wait for all the credits to roll: there you will find the best music in the movie.No one but the rubber-faced Jim Carrey could have carried off the role of The Grinch.  It would take a hyperactive over-actor like Mr. Carrey to pull it off through all the layers of latex and dyed Yak fur that he is encumbered with.Christine Baranski is always a delight to watch  though she is given little motivation for her character. The rest of the cast could just as easily have been done as animation.  But wait!  Isn't that how the original -- and still the greatest  version of this delightful story was done?","

","An adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story, best known from the 1966 animated TV version.It was all right, but I didn't find it to be anything particularly special. Certainly good makeup work. You wouldn't have known that the Grinch was Jim Carrey unless you looked at the credits, and even the Who's were pretty well made up. But it just didn't grab me. The most original part of the story, in fact, truly bothered me.Turns out that the Grinch isn't really a bad guy, after all. He was just a guy who was different and so he got picked on when he was a kid. Please! Give me a break! Why can't the Grinch be just a bad guy? But in our politically correct world, no one can be bad; we have to find ways to make sure that no one is actually responsible for the bad things they do. Thus, the Grinch isn't really responsible for being cranky - the kids who picked on him are. Whatever. The fun part of the TV version was that the Grinch was so absolutely and completely unlikeable. Now, I think we're supposed to feel sorry for him, but I didn't. I just felt kind of sorry that I rented the movie.It wasn't a disaster, but the next time I need a ""Grinch fix"" I think I'll stick with the cartoon.5/10","

","Overdone, strangely unhappy film version of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (Theodor S. Geisel).  Jim Carrey stars as the infamous Grinch, who is so terribly sickened by neighboring Whoville and their Christmas spirit that he sets out to defraud the town and ruin their favorite holiday.  This film, while allowing Carrey to roam free and create some undeniable laughs, is overdrawn (and possibly scary to kids), and prevents us from using our imaginations like the original story did.  It does add some interesting background information about the Grinch (namely a rough childhood as a spurned outcast in Whoville), and provides some fun, festive moments. However, this is always diluted by the ugly appearance of the Whos in Whoville (were they pig-nosed and repulsive in the story-book?), and the Grinch's menacing demeanor.  A little less style would have done director Howard well here.","

","Well.Little bit of history here.  When I first heard that they were working on a live-action remake of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"", I immediately filed it with ""the Wiz"", the live-action ""101 Dalmatians"" movies, and the rumored ""Marilyn Manson and the Chocolate Factory"" under Remakes Nobody Needs.  I was as enthusiastic about this movie as I was about ""Space Jam"".Furthermore, the original ""Grinch"" film, directed by Chuck Jones (who is, like, a god to me) and personally supervised by Dr. Suess is as close to perfect as any Christmas movie; or any animated short for that matter; has ever come to perfection.  It is sacred ground.  Do not touch.So this here movie had two or three strikes against it BEFORE I made myself watch it.There is good news.  Jim Carrey is an adorable Grinch.  I don't think anyone else could have pulled this off nearly as well.  Anytime he gives us the Patented Grinchy Grin, it... well, it made me nostalgic for the original. But, anyway, I can't blame him for this mess.  Everybody else, on the other hand, has to be taken into account.But, you know what, it's Christmastime.  And as the song goes, I'll let in light and banish the hate.  So I can't rightly yell at anyone.  Let me just give you my four-word review:STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL!!!!!!!Happy holidays to all.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594333/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594333,4," A vulgar and loud insult to Chuck Jones
","One hopes the screenplay, from the man who wrote Who Framed Roger Rabbit, might have been more clever and sharp than the product the incredibly talentless Ron Howard, and Jim Carrey (talented, but only when he's given some restrained direction ala The Mask) came up with in the end.Carrey does have a couple of good moments as he always does, but more times than not he mugs the jokes to death. Subtle he is not, and anyone who loves the original Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon as I do knows that subtle nuance is what made that cartoon a masterpiece.The Grinch should be more subdued rather than manic, shrewd with his mannerisms rather than in your face with them. He should have been presented for the first 30-40 minutes with some mystery, some build-up, some method to his madness as he presides over Whoville and comes to despise the sounds of Christmas' approach until he can't take it any more. What we get instead is instant gratification, throwing the Grinch at us in all his glory in the first 5 minutes of the story, then it allgoes downhill faster than his rocket sled from there. Until the last half hour anyway. The finale, as the Grinch decides to steal Christmas sticks mainly to the cartoon despite a modification or two, and is actually quite entertaining. What came before though was quite simply a mess.Having the Grinch's sad childhood depicted was just the worst possible direction the story could have gone in. Why do we care what the Grinch's backstory is. It could have been hinted at in the dialogue instead of shown. Howard has repeatedly shown in his films that he has no idea how to develop a character through thoughtful direction. Instead, like a previous member said, he just pulls out the giant mallett and hammers the character into our heads. Also, why couldn't the Who's have been depicted more like the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz, just there to forward the plot along and not saying anymore than they should. Who cares about the overbearing schmuck of a Mayor or Cindy Lou Who's parents, or the fact the whoville beauty queen is in love with the Grinch. It's obvious Howard went after a kind of Munchkinland feel to Whoville, but again he hasn't got a clue what made that movie great either. There's just too much useless dialogue and subplots. Superfluous, as Cindy Lou says.If someone like Rob Reiner or Robert Zemeckis had directed this it would have been given the comedic treatment it deserved. Howard needs to take a trip back to Mayberry to relearn what funny and sophisticated comedy is.In addition to the overdone antics, the Grinch is shot looking straight at his face too often. The best angles are his profile or at an angle. The make-up does not resemble the Grinch at all looking directly at him. There are moments when the production DOES look spot on but they are few and far between.Carrey is a pretty good choice for the Grinch, if someone would ever tell him to keep his yap shut, but the first hour should have been erased and redone. Ron Howard must be the culprit for the tatty way this production was handled.The attractive production design, Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou ( what a little sweetheart!) and a few of Carrey's better moments aren't enough to save this one from sliding over the cliff.","

","Dr. Suess must be rolling in his grave with this ""adaptation"" that is currently playing.  I have never once been so disappointed with a movie. It's hard to know where to start, but I'll try.Most of the blame falls on Carrey, who turned Suess' grumpy Grinch into a goofy Bigfoot.  Seriously, any fan of the children's book and classic Christmas special knows that the Grinch was not a goofy maniac who said some zippy one liners and played practical jokes.  I've read other posts that say no one else could have played the Grinch.  Two words: Jack Nicholson.The second problem comes to the Whos.  In Suess' work, they are an elitist culture who already knows what Christmas is all about.  In this movie, they are stupid and materialisic, and it's up to the corny Cindy Lou to teach them all (even though she never does, all she does is ask questions).  The best part of the book and Christmas special comes at the end when all the Whos come together to sing and welcome Christmas, with no thought whatsoever about the missing presents.  In this film, we get that after they all whine and complain about not getting their presents.This film was easily the biggest disappointment of the year.  It's a shame it's going on to make so much money.  It really doesn't deserve it.
This is what I've told for recommendations: if you want to go and see Jim Carrey goof off for 90 minutes, go see it.  But if you want to go and see Dr. Suess's story, do not.  That's the truth.","

","Depending on why you've decided to watch this movie, you'll either love it or hate it. For me, I was looking for another fun Christmas movie to add to the list because it's my favorite time of year. Man, was I disappointed. Although the plot is obviously well-known, the incorporation of human characters made it more frightening than memorable. On one hand, I will admit that the make-up and costume department did a phenomenal job, but on the other hand, I found the whole cast to be more likely to be seen in a horror movie. I was unable to connect with the characters because I simply felt repulsed by them throughout the entirety of the film. Beloved classics like ""Where Are You Christmas"" sung by Cindy Lou Who were cringe-worthy instead of charming. The best movies for me are the ones where you're transported into that reality and for the duration of the film, you forget where you are. Throughout How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I was looking at my watch rather than glued to the screen. Although, I will say that Jim Carrey did a phenomenal job embracing the character and making it his own. Unfortunately for me, I found the Grinch to be dull and not as comical as he was meant to be. If you come into this movie looking for nothing more than background noise to open presents to, then this is the movie for you. I found it to be neither emotional nor exciting, adventurous nor inspiring. The main character, the Grinch, summed up my feelings about the production with a perfect quote, ""Hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, double hate, loathe entirely.""","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3607562/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw3607562,1," How can anyone even find this entertaining?
","Wow, the summary title says it all doesn't it?Now as of me, I do enjoy a good Crimbo film every now and then. You turn on the telly, grab a nice drink of Cola or Coffee or even some random juice or something silly like that, and you enjoy a nice little film.Stuff like The Muppet Christmas Carol, Home Alone, It's A Wonderful Life, all that kind of wonderful stuff. These are beautiful Christmas films that has really good acting, some funny humour and of course something that'll tug your heart till you fall off your seat.Now you're probably thinking, why are you talking about other random Christmas films and not The Grinch my fellow bloke? Well, I say that because unlike all those other films I just mentioned The Grinch will probably instead immediately turn you into an absolute grouch by the time the credits start rolling.I'm dead serious, serious even to the bottom of my legs. I can not for the life of me stand this film whatsoever. Now before you all start chucking Tomatoes and broken TV's at me, I can STILL understand the appeal of this film so I'm not gonna whinge and moan at you all to not watch it because... you still can, I'm not greedy like that you know.What I am gonna do (for the others who don't wanna see it) tell you how awful this film is.First things first and probably most foremost, this is Jim Carrey at his absolute grating. Just look at him, look at him on ya TV screen. Running around, endlessly shouting, spurting out references the entire population will forget in under a second. Jesus, this Grinch gives the current CBBC presenters of today a run for their money.Another thing that's also foremost is Ron Howard's direction. (Spoiler alert: he's completely mis-directed) It feels off. Way too off for something like the Grinch, I can understand that he's going for a sort of wacky Burtonesque feel to it but in my eyes it makes the film look more tacky than it's supposed to be.Speaking of tacky, that sort of explains the jokes too. All tacky and rubbish like that crap joke you get in some cheap Christmas cracker. None of it stuck to me and I completely forgot about any of the jokes.And even at 90 or 100 something minutes, I honestly feel like the film's running 8 hours because everything is so loud and frantic you'll want to bash yourself on the head 8 million times and run around shouting ""THE NOISE! THE NOISE!"" so that the pain will stop.So any good stuff? Well, they kept that ""You're A Mean One"" song in (though it's a prime example I should be watching the far better Chuck Jones version instead).Ummm, Anthony Hopkins did a good job as the narrator. And Cindy Lou Who was the only one I even cared about, honestly I just wanted her to put the Grinch out his misery.So as you probably already knew, I hated this Grinch. Every minute of it was grating and I too now feel like a grumpy Grouch.BAH-HUMBUG! Yeah, you can all put it with your other Christmas classics, as for me I'm putting it in the bin with other Christmas clunkers like Jingle All The Way and Santa With Muscles so I never have to put up with anything like this again.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to watch the true version (Chuck Jones) so I can wipe those horrid memories away. Good day sir.","

","This movie is entirely too long, but what really annoys me... even more than the Grinch's overacting... is the nonsensical direction the story takes.The film attempts to tell the story of the Grinch, including a fully fleshed out back story of his childhood being emotionally damaged by the thoughtless Who children. Fair enough I suppose, except the original Grinch tale was about consumerism, and the real point of Christmas being love and family rather than gifts. This Grinch eventually arrives at the same change of heart as the original, quoting the same lines that Christmas ""came just the same,"" before returning the gifts. But why? None of it jives with his poor treatment by the Whos earlier on. Unlike the original Grinch who was only obsessed with the gifts, this version gives no explanation as to why he should have suddenly forgiven all of them. The entire thing feels arbitrary and ill-fitting.Add that to the excessive runtime and the general unlikability of most of the characters, and we're left with a film that doesn't deserve a spot in the annual holiday rotation.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3148387/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw3148387,2," Dr. Seuss Would Be Out-Raged
","Everything that is good, sweet and pure about the original is gone, replaced by a bloated, distorted and over-the-top mess. Jim Carrey does his usual schtick, mugging to the camera, acting so ridiculously over-the-top, he comes back around the other side and then over-the-top again. It's very reminiscent of his turn as the Riddler in Batman Forever. But Carrey is not the worst thing about this film. The entire film looks a little smug, like there was something on the camera lenses. All of Seuss' beautiful bright colors in the animated feature, gone. This movie has color but it's like viewing it through a dense smog. Because this is ""full length"" motion picture and the original animated film was only about an hour, we get an added hour consisting of why the Grinch came to hate Christmas and a Whoville Christmas Eve celebration that looks like something that came out of a nightmare. But the worst thing, the absolute worst abomination done to this generations-beloved story is the Who's themselves. They're materialistic and competitive extremists. What the heck? Seriously? These are the characters were supposed to feel sorry for as the Grinch steals their stuff? Plus, their characters are so over-the-top, it's almost like they're trying to compete with the Grinch character for the audience's attention. They're such awful people, I found myself rooting for the Grinch to take all of their stuff. Did the people who made this movie not get that the Grinch is supposed to be the villain of the piece? It's like they're all villains! Except for little Cindy Woo-Hoo. I get it, she's the innocent child who turns everybody else around, yada yada. But when the characters are so utterly detestable for the first hour and a half of the movie....uuuuhhh. In short, this film is....pretty awful. Yeah, once it ACTUALLY gets into the story we know, Carrey does a respectable job of playing the character we know and love. But why remake something that was so close to perfect in the first place? Do yourself a favor and sit down in front of the original: it's simple, to the point, has that great song--it should be a part of everyone's annual staple of holiday movies. This.....should just be forgotten about.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3148294/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw3148294,5," You THINK this movie is great... but take another look.
","A lot of people consider the live-action version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" to be a holiday classic, but have you really say down and looked at it? If you scrutinize this film even a little bit, you'd see that the film falls apart. You know the story, originally based on the book by Dr. Seuss. ""Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot... but the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-Ville, did NOT!"" Jim Carrey, donning some amazing and surprisingly expressive makeup plays the Grinch, a green, hairy, glass-eating, hazardous waste-loving, sarcastic and mean creature who decides to ruin the whole Christmas season for the residents of Who-ville.My brother is a big Dr. Seuss fan and had informed me numerous times that this film didn't really capture the feel of the book, that it missed the point of the whole Christmas season. I told him he was simply too attached to the source material, that books are different from movies and that of course they had to change some details here and there. Now that I've sat down and watched this Ron Howard effort, I have to agree with him. What's frustrating is that there are many elements that are incredibly well done and I can see how this could have worked and why everyone was on-board when they announced the project.Let's begin with what works. I can't comment enough on how good Jim Carrey looks as the Grinch. It brings me back to the wonderfully expressive makeup used in the original ""Planet of the Apes"". Even though Carrey is covered head-to-toe in green paint, prosthetics and hair, he remains swift and expressive. The face in particular is a true marvel. His yellow eyes, the way the wrinkles in his face appear when he smiles that most devious and iconic smile, the way he is able to contort his face, it's what every makeup artist dreams of. The visual greatness is not limited there. The Whos are very well done (I did not find them to be unsettling, I thought they looked great) and the sets are equally impressive. I loved seeing the wacky-looking bridges and machinery because it does feel like it is capturing the whimsical and fantastical source material. Even the costumes worn throughout are a lot of fun to see. They get more and more extravagant as it gets further along. Every frame of this film is packed to the brim with style.The problem lies with the plot. This movie feels incredibly padded. By adding two iconic songs and some lengthy descriptions of the Whos' presents, Chuck Jones made the book into a 25 minute short. How much material then, did the writers have to add to more than triple the length to make this an hour and a half movie?! And what's added; is it more of the most iconic parts of the film, the scenes where the Grinch steals Christmas? NO! It's additional back story for the Grinch, which adds nothing to plot and in fact makes the movie contradict itself (I'll get back to that). What is this contradiction in the film? Let me quote it directly: ""The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason."" Nope, not true. Many Whos know the reason for why the Grinch does not like Christmas. Are you ready for it? The mind-blowing explanation, the mystery that has plague Seussians ever since the book was written... it's a titanic letdown. Apparently he was born evil, and also mistreated during Christmas time.I found that a lot of the material added made it go in all sorts of contradicting directions. Is the movie for children? If it is, why do we have jokes about key parties and the Grinch checking out sexy Whos? Is the movie supposed to be about the true meaning of Christmas, or are the Whos not supposed to know what it's about? Not only are they quick to judge people on their appearance (since they make fun of the Grinch's look multiple times) but apparently to the residents of Who-ville, Christmas is all about presents and sales, popularity contests and being more extravagant than your neighbor. What a selfish and materialistic holiday. Is the movie supposed to make us like the Grinch, or are we supposed to cheer for the residents of Who-ville? The Grinch is funny and he's against the materialistic nature of the holiday. I can't blame the Grinch for not liking Christmas because I also disliked the Whos' celebration.Even the sweetest resident of Who-ville (Cindy-Lou Who, remember her from those three pages in the book? Now she's a main character!) is so stupid she can't tell the difference between Santa and the Grinch in a quickly-made Santa Suit. Then this film raises whole new levels of bewilderment when we see the REAL Santa shop up briefly too. Does he bring additional presents to everyone? Isn't that kind of derivative? ARE presents the true meaning of Christmas then? There are some moments that I genuinely liked about ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", but I really don't feel like it captures the book it's based on, or even the season it's meant to comment about. Technically it's magic, but the story is a contradicting mess. I still have some small affection for it, but there's nothing that this film brings to the table that you couldn't find in the animated special from 1966. They knew it too because they jack several moments from that original story and throw them in here, even if they don't fit. They managed to turn ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" into a bag of smelly socks, it's downright embarrassing. ""How the Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" is a movie that you THINK is great, but the more you look and really analyze it, the more you'll realize is genuinely weak. (On DVD, December 13, 2014)","

","It's unfortunate that this large scale production was not put into a traditional account of the Grinch story. Ron Howard, who has directed so many Frank Capra style movies for mainstream audiences, had to twist the plot around and use special effects for a movie that confuses young audiences and detracts from the message. The cast and special effects could have produced a classic from the Grinch story; a movie to reinforce the Christmas message from Dr. Seuss's wonderful children's book. In the end, the movie did return to the original theme but the story was already ruined. There were so many deviations from the story and over the top scarifying scenes that it amounts to a travesty of a great Christmas tale.","

",So I finally decided to watch this on VHS last night as I never seen this movie in over 10 years and I finally decided to watch it again as the last time I seen this movie it scared the crap outta me.The Grinch is a Dr Seuss book adaptation that got turned into a film by Ron Howard(who directed Splash) and stars Jim Carrey as the title charcther. It tells the story of the Grinch(played by Jim Carrey who's donning a suit and prosthetics)who hates Christmas and Whoville because he was bullied as a kid by a young boy who is now the mayor of Whoville (played by Jeffery Tambor who voiced Big Nosed Thug in Tangled) and to that day he never liked Xmas because of that. So he does all in his power to ruin Christmas for the Whovilles by stealing their presents and destroying their Xmas tree. But when a young girl from Whoville called Cindy(played by a very young Taylor Monsom)enters the Grinch's life can the Grinch ever learn to love Xmas?Overall the comedy in this is funny especially one scene that cracked me up where The Grinch is driving this little car that blows up and he jumps away from the car and does this funny thing in slow motion.Is it a good movie well its kinda stupid but still Jim Carrey is my favorite actor and you gotta give him credit for wearing that green suit(he first wore something green by playing The Mask in 1994 with Cameron Diaz where he wore a green mask that has magical powers with whoever wears it) but hey his a very funny actor and if you like Jim Carrey then check it out next Xmas as its a Xmas movie.Overall its a 5.,"

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1843990/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw1843990,5," A glossy, sugary confection saved single handed by Jim Carrey
","Now might be a peculiar time of year to be writing a review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas. But then ITV just did the peculiar thing of showing it today. And at Easter no less! Oh well, there wasn't much else on TV, so I decided to watch Ron Howard's lovingly crafted tribute to Dr Seuss's most famous fictional character.I remember whiling away many hours of my childhood on the gleeful, charming absurdities of Dr Seuss. The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham were perennial favourites of mine. And of course, so was How the Grinch Stole Christmas.And what an anarchic children's story it is. The tale of a lovably wicked creature, the Grinch who hates everything and anything to do with Christmas. Living on the top of Mt Crumpit, he loathes and despises the people of Whoville, who act like its Christmas everyday. So he hatches a plan to ruin Christmas for the people he looks down on, by stealing their presents right out from under their noses (and boy do they have noses!) on Christmas Eve.Now of course the book is a very slim affair, so Ron Howard has to expand upon a few things. He even gives us a Grinch back-story. But unfortunately, the film version disappoints. Although a visual treat, the appealing wickedness of the story book has become buried by the A-list machinery of the sets and production values.I don't think Ron Howard was the director to bring the world of Dr Seuss to life. What the film really needed was someone like Tim Burton at the helm. In fact I can't think of a filmmaker more suited to Dr Seuss' sensibilities. Some of the films he's made are clearly akin to the mind of Dr Seuss. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfect example. A film that achieved a perfect balance between the grotesque and the sincere. As well as his recent remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Ron Howard's films are ones designed to appeal to the Academy Award winning crowd. Ones that celebrate the strength of the human spirit. He hasn't really got the wacky imagination to let the world of Dr Seuss truly come to life. And while he's clearly put a great deal of thought into the world of Whoville, the film still looks very stagebound. Everything is crammed in as tightly as possible. From squashed in bungalows to tiny fieldmice. The film would be a glossy, empty confection, were it not for one thing......Jim Carrey. Now Jim Carrey can be an intensely annoying actor. Especially when he goes over the top. His antics have sunk many a film on his resume. Batman Forever, The Cable Guy and Liar Liar are all prime examples. Where the directors of those films foolishly refused to rein him in. So its all the more surprising than that Jim Carrey does just brilliantly as The Grinch.This is one of the greatest performances he has ever delivered. Like the one other really good manic character he's played, The Mask, his OTT excesses feel completely appropriate. Where in the other films I mentioned, Carrey was put into roles that didn't really suit his typically out of control theatrics, he gets it very right as The Grinch.The Grinch is a character that seems perfectly attuned to Carrey's manic energy. Much like The Mask. And Ron Howard seems to sense that too. Which is why he allows him to give a performance of zero restraint. And as a result reaches stratospheric heights.Buried under an impressive makeover by the excellent Rick Baker, Carrey is a thundering cyclone. Hopping about with energy, clearly enjoying himself immensely, he is the life and soul of the party. Whenever he's around, you sit up and pay attention (not hard considering he's green all over).I don't envy him either. The hours he must have had to spend in the makeup chair. Those contact lenses must have been torture. But it never shows through in his performance. His enthusiasm for the role shines right through the makeup. And its animated enough to allow him plenty of mischievous grins and lopsided smirks. Giving a sharp, edgy take on the role, Carrey makes The Grinch one of his most memorable creations.What is especially gratifying about the way Jim Carrey plays The Grinch is the fact that even as he softens, he never loses his edge. Yes he does come to understand the spirit of Christmas, but there's still a bit of a grouch left in The Grinch. One particularly delightful moment comes when his heart grows a few inches. His faithful dog Max jumps into his lap licking him mercilessly expecting high praise. Instead he gets a harsh rebuke: ""Beat it! One step at a time!""Jim Carrey is the best thing in the whole film. The rest of the cast don't have a prayer of keeping up with him. He's the sole reason to watch the film at all. There's something tremendously satisfying (not to mention liberating) watching him tear down the superficial, hollow shell of Whoville. Its a pity he repents on that because Whoville looks better without all the adornments.You're never in any doubt who's behind the makeup, but Carrey makes The Grinch large as life. With lots of pithy, spiteful dialogue to spout as well as neverending insults and putdowns, Carrey does a superb job of bringing The Grinch to the big screen.Its just a shame the rest of the film isn't as good. It'll be interesting to see how Carrey does in the latest Dr Seuss film, Horton Hears a Who! Since he's an actor who seems very in sync with Seuss, I'm sure he'll be just as good there.","

","I won't judge those critics and people (mostly US based) who dumps this movie just because it doesn't fit with their vision of this classic character. For me, considering that I don't give a snowflake about roots of this movie, it simply rocks. It is not overdone, it is quite long, but not so long as it could be; interesting costumes and hairdos, script is well balanced and full of enjoyable jokes and references, but in same time never letting carry the story away from audience. It is not perfect, but it is there.Yes, yes, it is all you can have in any another good movie with good supporting team, but this time, that all is just perfect add-on to one and one persona and character only - Grinch itself. You can hate or love Jim Carrey, but this time he has done it right. His spoof jokes, a little bit over-the-top emotions are right on target this time.And with all those jolts of fun and laughs, movie achieves to bring very simple and true message with it - Christmas and in fact, any celebration is about people, not goodies you get (common sense very frequently forgotten by children and their parents too). Very good, balanced family movie, which can be enjoyed also watching it alone or with someone dear.","

","This movie is great, funny and gives a whole new look to the classic cartoon. The film gives a funny look to the grouchy character that we all know. It also gives more storyline. In this version the Mayor of Whooville embarrassed the Grinch when they were at school as their class mates were giving Christmas Presents to one another and as a result he climbed to the top of the Mountain and has never been seen since. Now when Cindy-loo whoo nominates him for an award, he is forced to come down to accept the award. When the mayor embarrasses him again, he ruins the town and sets the giant Christmas tree on fire. But when his famous plan comes together and is finally touched by Cindi-Loo coming to visit him on Christmas he....oh, you know the rest. All in All a great family film and very enjoyable.","

","What can I say? THIS is the pinnacle of Christmas movies. We're talking grade A family entertainment here.Anyways, the plot focuses on the Grinch, played perfectly by Jim Carrey, being convinced to go down to a little town that's obsessed with Christmas called Whoville for a Christmas celebration. Needless to say, the Grinch hates Christmas and every living creature in Whoville, so all does not go well.So, the Grinch sets out to ruin Christmas that night. And that's when the fun REALLY starts.Overall, you should go buy this movie on DVD. Right now. I TELL YOU, MAN, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS.My god, could the theme song get any more catchy?","

","When I first sat down to watch this, I was skeptical that I'd find it enjoyable. My initial suspicions were confirmed when I saw the Whos with those EXTREMELY annoying upturned noses. It drove me crazy. Plus, the little girl's triangle-shaped hair made me want to take a lawn mower or machete or just something to it to make it go away.But once I got past that, I learned to appreciate the humor Jim Carrey delivers as the Grinch. While the movie is heavily reliant on pun-like jokes, there is a lot of visual humor that I found myself laughing out loud at.Plus, if you like surrealistic humor, this movie is definitely for you. It's wild and unpredictable in that nature.Basically, a movie that I thought would be painful to watch turned out to be very good, exactly what you need if you just want to laugh without thinking very hard. I know I liked it.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1212272/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw1212272,NA," Whodunnit . . . and why?
","Unmitigated garbage. Ron Howard has never been a big proponent for subtlety. Most of his artwork is house painting, not oils or watercolors. And he uses a sledgehammer instead of a brush. Yet, he has produced a few excellent works--A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13 come to mind. Here, he takes on Dr. Seuss and his endearing story of the power of grace and giving . . . and repaints it with a Hollyweird 10 pound sledge.What infuriated me the most about Grinch is that Howard apparently, in his infinite wisdom, decided to fundamentally change the story of the excluded and marginalized monster of the Grinch, hateful of and hurting for the transcendent love of his neighboring innocents known as the Who's, who decides to punish them for their goodness, and realizing almost too late that he has nothing to fear from the Who's' limitless love. Instead, Howard turns the Who's into a pack of, to use a line from a Charlton Heston movie, ""rapacious bastards."" The Who's are so common, so greedy and materialistic, that somehow the Grinch will be inspired to goodness in spite of them. Howard's Who's are repulsive, nasty, and Republican (this is Hollywood, you remember)--there's very little to root for here, except the obligatory one, lone Who who models liberal virtue, Cindy Lou Who and Jim Carrey's breathtakingly funny Grinch.Why change a beautiful story? Probably because of one of two options: The producers of this trash figured we were (and still are) dumb enough as viewers not to notice that the Who's were now rotten to the core or changing the Who's was the only way for Howard to fill 90 minutes of screen time with 20 minutes of story. Either way (or both), How the Grinch Stole Christmas has sold a bazillion tickets and DVD's.I have an in-law who is intellectually stuck on ""concrete-operational"" and can't, for the life of her, understand why I hate this movie (""How can you hate this movie? It's Fuh-nee!""). I am not, never have been, never will be, any great intellectual wunderkind, but Ron Howard and company have banked on getting richer yet by playing to the concrete thinkers of the nation. The movie is depressing and dispiriting, and the only way to get away from this loud, offensive gas bubble of a movie is to quietly read Dr. Seuss's lovely little story to your children . . .With no special effects, no zillion dollar stars, nothing but Seuss's words and illustrations.But then again, you've got to be able to read.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594498/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594498,9," Better than Advertised
","Panned by critics and loathed by Seuss purists, this movie managed to capture just enough hearts to lasso in $260 million when it opened in 2000. Ron Howard's recipe for The Grinch is more of a smorgasbord, and as such, reactions were varied depending on who liked which parts.The visuals, a combination of elaborate sets and costumes and computer graphics, are a stunning replica of Seussian illustrations.  Buildings and walkways are odd-shaped, almost organic, and machines are crammed full of moving parts and oversized cogs.  The colors are crisp but the palette is somewhat muted.  It seems more natural for a Seussian world to look like a Technicolor musical but in fact the books were themselves simple and soft on the eyes.  The costumes are festive and creative, like Cindy Lou's family dressed up like a Christmas dinner, with plates and cookies and hats shaped like mugs of eggnog.  James Horner's score is par for the course, a mixture of the film's storybook mood and Horner's own penchant for stealing from his own work.The story is a melting pot of popular culture, borrowing heavily from the book, stealing settings from the Chuck Jones cartoon, and adding some modern flavor; some psychological background on the Grinch's troubled childhood mixed with a new twist on the Who's, who seem to have let their Christmas become commercialized.  Seuss purists may prefer to think of the Who's as being more innocent; after all, the Grinch learned his lesson from watching the innocent Who's without their presents.  Chuck Schulz probably wasn't happy, thinking he had the market on commercialized Christmas cornered with his classic Charlie Brown Christmas.  I'm not really thrilled with this twist either, but it's one way to take the story from a ten-minute book to a half-hour cartoon to a 90-minute film.Roger Ebert was a little hard on this film, saying it was too dark and focused on the Grinch's meanness.  I thought as one-dimensional as the Who's are in the story, they tried too hard to expand on THEM.  The Fat One is never wrong, but I have to say, the Grinch is the central focus of the story, and as such deserves every second of screen time he gets. Hollywood is a town that recognizes Jim Carrey's comic genius, but still doesn't quite know what to do with it.  Ron Howard is one of the more recent to try. Carrey is given all the comedic stylings he can handle; from a eerily good impression of Boris Karloff; to the Chuck Jones cartoon images of skittering on the floor on his fingers and toes, the old saw-the-floor-under-the-tree gag and the triumphant lifting of the sled on Mt. Crumpit; to physical gags of every variety (Carrey yanks a cloth off a table, leaving numerous pots and pans untouched, then returns to upset them all and tip the table); to spoofs of several popular movies (Chariots of Fire comes to mind); to other pop culture gags (Carrey checks an answering machine message, his greeting is ""If you so much as utter one syllable, I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND GUT YOU LIKE A FISH!  ... if you'd like to fax me, press the * key).  With the combination of voices, facial expressions and overacting, I still hang on every word he says; to this day I'm tickled when he puts on a Navy ball cap and spoofs his own director.His supporting cast is more than competent.  Christine Baranski, his unrequited love, is her typecast snooty self (and with a bit more cleavage than Seuss might appreciate).  Taylor Momsen is the quintessential darling as Cindy Lou Who, and her father (Bill Irwin) is both naive (The Grinch wraps her up in paper, her father says upon finding her ""You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping"") and heartwarming (the mayor yells ""What's the matter with you?!?  She's a child!"" and he says plainly, ""she's MY child... and she happens to be right."")  Molly Shannon is the standard annoying suburban housewife, Ron's brother Clint Howard steals scenes as the mayor's toadie, and the rest of the town is largely populated with stereotypes: old biddies, an Irish cop, a chunky self-important mayor, a prudish teacher, and so on).  The whole story is wonderfully narrated by the gentle, articulate voice of Anthony Hopkins.I'm one of maybe 7 people on Planet Earth that actually enjoyed nearly all the pieces of this muddled Seussian story.  But I recommend it all the same, no matter what the Fat One says.","

","To say I was shocked and appalled would be an understatement -- I was shocked and appalled, but more than that, I was just plain BORED.  Poor Ted Geisel is turning over in his grave, and just about everybody involved in producing (not to mention marketing) this flick ought to be ashamed of themselves.  It is one of the purest, schmaltziest ""made for a marketing campaign so people will spend money"" (wait, check that, spend a lot of money) movies to come out in a long time.  And the worst part of it is, the original theme of the original story was ""Shuck marketing hell. Understand what the *real* holidays are all about.""And the least they could have done, if they were going to destroy the message, was at least make the movie fun.  Make the Grinch somewhat hateable, instead of making the movie hateable. He was supposed to be a *mean* one, not a misunderstood practical joker sensitive man of the 90's.But I guess that's marketing.1 of 5 stars.  You'll have to force yourself to laugh, and then you'll hate yourself for it afterwards.  (Even the kids in the aisle below me were falling asleep.)","

","I must admit, the only film I previously liked Jim Carrey in was ""The Mask"". Not anymore. I wondered if he was occasionally vulgar, but ultimately I thought he was cute and very funny. I thought the sets, makeup, and hairstyles were astounding, like the cartoon had literally ""come to life"". I didn't have a clue what the film would be like, and I wasn't disappointed at all. Jim Carrey's acting was inspired. I cannot compare Boris Karloff with Jim Carrey because they are both so different, but I like them both as the Grinch! I also appreciate that the quotes from the cartoon and book were in here too, but not so much that it got redundant. Jim Carrey was ""The Grinch"" as I never thought he could be!I thought that the way Ron Howard had lengthened the original story to fit a 2 hour movie was very good. Some of you, I know, will not think so, and to you who fit that description, don't be so hard on this movie. What else could they do but have a personal history of the Grinch if Cindy Lou Who wanted to find out about him? The cartoon should have been longer. The acting is almost completely over-the-top (except for the kind-hearted Cindy Lou Who, played by Taylor Momsen), but that is the way it should have been because this is a fantasy.The special effects Ron Howard also had a right to do. The Dumpit to Crumpit, Christmas light guns, flying sleigh, etc., were ingenious. You can't find special effects in the cartoon!","

It feels about 3 hours long and most scenes resemble the horrid outtake material that would be quickly cut from any quality film! The over-blown special effects are designed solely to cover up the complete lack of any original ideas or laughs. For adults, the sole highlight (or low point, depending on how you look at it) of this trash is a wife swapping gag (quick shot of keys dumped into bowl) that makes you wonder how it got into this film. Dr. Seuss would roll over in his grave if he had the chance to see this pathetic excuse for entertainment! In closing, both Howard and Carrey should be ashamed of themselves for shoving this mess down our throats! Holiday films have reached a new low!","

","I guess I am a purist.  I am a huge fan of the original cartoon and its uplifting spirit.  Since the story had to be embellished to stretch its length, much of the added story is sad, mean or crude.  The Whos are not portrayed as very innocent.  They have their character flaws.  The audience I saw the movie with did not laugh very much, along with myself.  However, I did hear kids leaving the theater say they really enjoyed the movie.  Jim Carrey is great in the role and the young actor that plays Cindy Lou is also fantastic.  The movie has its moments, but it did not leave me feeling good like the cartoon did.","

","I was scouting this movie out to see if my 4yr old would like it. There are a few scary scenes for little ones. Definitely not for under 6!. But they took a lot of the charm and elegant simplicity out of the video and book. The Whos are not very likeable and while Jim Carrey does a good job, you will find yourself disappointed. Do yourself a favor, buy/rent the video cartoon done by Chuck Jones (and the screenplay written by Seuss himself, as well as the songs) or better yet, read the book to your kids. You'll like that better.Besides, all of the marketing and cross promotion associated with this movie is disconcerting. It is exactly the opposite of the point of the story. How would Seuss himself react to Grinch cereal?","

Perhaps they were so wrapped up in picking it apart that they didn't take time to enjoy it.  Jim Carrey was fantastic, (little Cindy Lou was even better), the set was magical, the direction was great, the rhyming and who-ing all worked - all in all it was pretty spectacular.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594383/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594383,10," Take A Trip To Whoville
","When such an eagerly awaited, highly anticipated movie like this comes along, you have to ask yourself, can any film live up to the hype?  Well, the answer in this case is, You Bet It Can.  Resoundingly.  `How The Grinch Stole Christmas,' directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey, is a triumph to be embraced by the ages.  It's a warm and touching, funny and highly entertaining piece of film making, satisfyingly brought to fruition by Howard, seemingly the perfect choice to direct such a vehicle as this. But make no mistake about it, this movie belongs to Jim Carrey, who was born to play this part. 	Nobody, but NOBODY, could have pulled this off better than Carrey.  It's a dazzling demonstration of his talents; he has all the tools and uses every one of them in bringing the Grinch to life.  From the Sean Connery voice he affects, to the physical bits he manages, to the exceptional costuming and makeup that help make it all fly, it's an exemplary performance in every way.  Amazingly enough, there's no trace of Jim Carrey left here; he manages to disappear totally into the character, a transformation so complete that what you see is pure Grinch from the inside out.  He pulls out all the stops and lets himself go with it, without ever taking it too far over the top. Howard, who obviously knew exactly what he wanted from his star, must get some credit as well for keeping the naturally exuberant Carrey on track, while allowing him to find his own comfort zone that made it all work. 	Howard uses a gentle touch with the film, letting the natural humor work on it's own without ever forcing it, while infusing some sly, subtle comedic bits that work well and keep it all from slipping into anything sappy or pretentious.  It's a feel-good film without the maudlin overtones to which so many other films of this nature have succumbed over the years.  And what a credit this is to the versatility of Howard, who proves here that he can take you into outer space or to `Whoville' with equal alacrity and expertise. 	The supporting cast includes Christine Baranski, who turns in a wickedly funny performance as Martha May Who-vier; Jeffrey Tambor (Mayor of Whoville); Molly Shannon (Betty Lou-Who); Josh Ryan Evans (8 Year Old Grinch); Taylor Momsen (Little Cindy Lou-Who); Bill Irwin (Lou Lou-Who); and Clint Howard (Whobris).  With `How The Grinch Stole Christmas,' Howard and Carrey have provided us with an instant classic; a delightful film with a lot of heart that is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end.  A great way to kick off the holiday season, this movie is destined to become an annual tradition with audiences everywhere.  In the end, this is what movies are all about:  Pure Magic.  I rate this one 10/10.","

","When I heard that there was going to be a remake of the timeless Dr. Seuss classic, my first reaction was 'there will never be anything that good'. Well, I'll admit that I was terribly wrong! This movie was delightful, hilarious (with a little adult humor) and Jim Carrey was delightful!   Of course, Ron Howard changed the film story a little bit to explain a few things and added a few new characters for some extra spice. But, believe it or not, that made the movie better! Jim Carrey's version of the Grinch was absolutely fascinating. Taylor Mensom's little Cindy Lou Who was so cute, I just wanted to cry when she said 'I just wanted to give everybody a merry Christmas. Even Mr. Grinch.'  Needless to say, go out and see it. It's worth it!","

","""All I want for Christmas is my family."" Ron Howard is a genius in family entertainment. The direction of this movie is magical, from shot selection to editing to digital effects. This is the most creative vision since ""The Wizard of OZ"" and the most heart-warming motion picture since ""Its a Wonderful Life"". Jim Carrey demonstrates his full range of talents, from outstanding comedic contributions to enrapturing dramatic emotional appeal. This is the art of movie-making at its best. All of the negative comments anyone else provides simply demonstrates that they cannot let themselves relax and enjoy childhood emotions again.","

","Ron Howard's version of The Grinch turned a wonderful children's book about love overcoming greed into an outsider revenge story complete with an alternate bad guy.  Apparently the original plot violates the Hollywood code by allowing the bad guy to get away without being punished.  Why not make a new version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and create a new character to take the fall at the end?  Scrooge's silent, more evil partner perhaps.","

","Let me set the scene. It is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies. I am with my friend deciding what to see. We look for a movie that is starting soon and ""The Grinch"" comes up. We buy tickets not knowing what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster of fun.Jim Carrey (who may I add is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. It really brought this childhood movie to life.The story is based upon the story of the grinch. As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas. He lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. But one little girl is going to change The Grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way.Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. She attempts to break the barrier and to help the Grinch move in and mingle with the towns people.All up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim.","

An incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville atmosphere, astonishing variety of costumes. Wait, there's more to it than that - the story is very good, too.

I'm sure she has some great future. The dog is cool. All in all, it's a very high quality Christmas fairy-tale. If you like fairy-tales, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you.Reading some other reviews here... Get a life. It hurts me every time to see people out there who... well... got their hearts two sizes too small.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594254/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594254,10," Taylor Momsen & Jim Carrey
","First an explanation on what makes a great movie for me.  Excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time I watch it (case en point:  Twister).  There are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas is THE MAN), and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a DVD or VHS tape?  Characters.  With that said, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch.  Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey.  The rest of the cast was very good, particularly Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, and Josh Ryan Evans.  But, every single scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very funny and/or heartwarming.   Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon.  The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts, and a very good theme (I can't get started because I don't want to spoil it).  Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch-particularly when he interacted with Cindy.  And the music!  Wow! Excellent music by James Horner.  I loved his selection of instruments and the compositions.  Very good job Jim Carrey-I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen!  Whoa!  Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once.  On your solo - Where Are You Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds?  Sounds like an F#?  That is an obscene range for a 7-year old (obscene meant in the best possible way).  Great job.  This is the best performance by a child I have ever heard in a movie(Taylor beat out the Von Trapp Children-no small feat!).  And now to the actors.  Jim Carrey was great, funny, and, surprisingly very sensitive (this really showed through in his scenes with Taylor Momsen).  Taylor Momsen's unspoken expressions(one of the secrets to a good acting performance) are very strong-she really becomes Cindy Lou Who.  And when she does dialogue she is even stronger.******************************danger:spoiler alert********************* ***********************************************************************Examples:  expression when she first sees The Grinch.  This is a classic quote (""You're the the the"" and then filled in with the Grinch line ""da da da THE GRINCH-after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by The Grinch).  The ""Thanks for saving me"" quote and subsequent response by The Grinch was also very good.My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister.  This scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other.  Little Taylor Momsen completely holds her own with Jim Carrey in this spot.  I sincerely hope we see Taylor Momsen in many more films to come.  All in all everything was great about this movie (except maybe the feet and noses).","

","THE GRINCH was the best American movie made since Forrest Gump. Absolutely extraordinary.  I've read the other comments and I'm embarrassed of everyone that didn't like the film.  The irony is that they're the very essence of what the film was talking about - needy, greedy, ""what can you do for me?"" type people.  If the story doesn't tell you exactly what you want, then it's not good.  If Jim Carrey's voice isn't exactly what you want, then it's not good.  If the little girl doesn't sing exactly the way you want, then it's not good.I'm a filmmaker myself.  I've made three films which are found on this website as well and suddenly, I don't feel as bad about some of the comments I've received.The bottom line is Ron Howard, Taylor Momford (?), and Jim Carrey poured their hearts out for this film.  It is so evident.  Jim Carrey brought so much humanity to the role.  He was so likeable yet when he stood on that mountain staring down the ""whos"", there was so much pain and hate inside his eyes.  Having worked with actors, it's easy to see that Jim was coming from a real place.  The poor guy leaves everything on the set and he still gets criticised.  I hope to God that Jim stumbles upon this review (which I highly doubt he will) but he needs to know that his effort was noted.  But someone like Jim Carrey probably knows this already and steps on doubters like ants on the grass.I predict this movie will be a classic just like the Wizard of Oz and the Grinch television show itself.  It will transcend the doubts of the doubters and will reach generations far beyond the ones that didn't like this film.
Ron Howard this was your best work.  It was seamless.  The transitions were nifty and appropriate.  You kept Jim under wraps and never let Jim slip out too much.  Your choice of casting was excellent.  The sets, the hair, the music, the pacing, everything - A+.And the girl.  Oh my God the girl.  She changed my life.  I'm 32 without wife or child and she made me dream of both.  She was magical without even trying.  Her voice was pure and perfect.  How dare someone critique her singing.  She's just a kid and she was singing honestly and isn't that what it's all about!!!!!!?  She was an angel.  The way she smiled and laughed, and even better, the way she stood toe to toe with Jim Carrey.  One of the best child actors I've seen since Natalie Portman's Professional.What a message that movie sent!  Of course it was different than the TV show.  It needs to be.  We're different.  Times have changed.  We need to hear different things.  Years ago, Christmas was different so the Grinch was appropriate back then but now try going to a mall and tell me it hasn't changed.  Try giving your kid a hug and an apple for Christmas and see how he reacts.  This movie was so appropriate and people can't handle looking at the mirror too long.Wonderful effort by all parties involved.  I HOPE I can make a movie half as good.Mr. Howard, Mr. Carrey, and Brian Grazer thank you for the clues.  I'm not just stopping the sled - I'm picking it up and raising it over my head.  I think most people (judging from the comments) would let it fall of the cliff.Bravo.  Fine work everybody!!","

","Wow! What can I say about DR. SUESS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS? The old cartoon is a classic, really, & if anyone disagrees they were drunk when they saw it. But when I heard that they were making THE GRINCH all I could think about is...how can you turn a 30 minute cartoon into an hour & 30 minute movie? Well, no need to ask that question because it was done. Wow! The best movie of 2000 & my favourite movie since TITANIC & THE GREEN MILE. Jim Carrey is great! If you're a die hard Carrey fan then you'll love it. If you hate Carrey & see it you'll love it! Jim Carrey gets so into character & there couldn't've been a better Grinch. From Carrey's bad role in ME, MYSELF, & IRENE to Carrey's best role in THE GRINCH, THE GRINCH will be a family movie to watch all year around. This is a family movie. Parents, don't worry about taking your 4 year old to it because it's PG. Take 'em. If you don't, perhaps its your heart that's 2 sizes to small!","

","Anyone who has a heart that, as a kid, was touched by the wonder-filled, magical fable of the original animated Grinch will feel obligated to punch out Ron Howard if they ever meet him in real life. They took a pure and innocent tale we all loved and turned it into a hollow, lifeless piece of marketing, a movie that was more an unofficial sequel to the Mask, or the worst parts of the Batman films, than the simple story it should have been.Jim Carrey was exquisitely Jim Carrey, but even if he is the living embodiment of a cartoon, his casting was a disservice to the movie. Catchphrases, sexual innuendo, pithy references to current events and attitudes - these things are appropriate for 'youth-oriented product positioning', not a timeless fable of childhood innocence. The film needed much more in the way of wonder than it did potty humor and snappy jokes.
Of course, one can't ultimately blame Ron Howard, because he was raised in Hollywood - his childhood may actually have been like that.","

","My reaction will be inconceivable, heretical, to devotees of thecartoon, which is obviously deeply ingrained into the US Xmasexperience. In the UK it is largely unknown (as is Frosty the Snowman)and has been retitled simply The Grinch for distribution here. When Ifinally saw the cartoon in New York last Xmas I was disappointed by thequality of the animation, the narration and the crude black and whitemorality. I adored the movie, which greatly improved upon the narrative by making( spoiler alert!)  the Grinch's feelings partly justified and shared bythe little girl in the town, the mayor less likeable than the Grinch,and the Grinch the object of the town's most glamorous woman's love andlust! This broke up the cartoon's simplistic duality, so that the townand the Grinch learn from each other, and not all just one way. Packedwith hilarious adult jokes such as references to other movies (e.g. thecar-keys in a bowl  the Who community practice wife-swapping as in TheIce Storm) and beautiful on the eye. I entirely forgot that it was Careycapering before me on the screen. It was the Grinch, the real Grinch.However, almost all the things I admire about this are probably whatwill upset devotees of the cartoon. This will be the first encounterwith the Grinch for most British children, so I'm interested to see whatwill be the reaction of those I know on seeing the cartoon second. Iwouldn't be surprised if UK TV will start showing it on Xmas from nowon. I had just been given my first Xmas present so I fortuitously watchedthe movie with the wrapped box on my lap. I felt renewed by this movieand ready to enter the fray of Xmas shopping with a refreshedmotivation, thanks entirely to the Grinch's insight...............................","

","I am by far a Dr. Seuss fan.  I disagree with how some of the stories are written.  I wouldn't be surprised if children who read it, go around talking like it thinking it's the right way to talk.  But I've ALWAYS loved 'How the grinch stole christmas' ever since I was little.  I grew tired of all the other christmas shows like rudolph and frosty, and never grew tired of this wonderful classic so I couldn't wait to see it when it came out to film.I had gone to Toronto with my parents to visit my sister, her soon to be 5 kids.  While visiting, me being 19, took my two nieces (8 and 4) to the movies to see the grinch.  Of course, my father and sister came along as well.As soon as we stepped into the theatre and found ourselves seats, my 4 year old niece had her face glued to the screen as soon as she sat down (and this was when it was starting to show the movie (after the previews were aired, we never saw them).I absolutely loved it.  And so did my nieces.  Whether or not they caught the jokes doesn't matter because not everyone catches jokes or the meaning of things the first time through unless you're pure lucky.  But as long as you enjoyed it whatever your age is, that's the whole point of the film. I mean, who would want to go to the movies and sit through the whole thing only to not like it.I recommend it to anyone out there who likes the grinch.  My nieces loved it even if they didn't catch all the jokes but trust me, children laugh at things even if they don't get the joke.  Annoying, but true :P  But again, as long as they enjoyed it, that's all that matters.No one could have played the grinch like Jim and no one could have played Cindy Lou Who like Taylor :)  So adorable ^_^;But course...  *praise* my nieces are just as cute :D  *end praise* :)","

","This film—one of Ronnie Howard's crowning achievements—was a triumph of perfect casting, namely in the person of one Jim Carrey. I have always believed that Carrey is our greatest living physical comedian, nearly eclipsing even the great Buster Keaton. But even Keaton couldn't have pulled off the part of Dr. Seuss' most memorable character, especially the superb vocal component (the featured song, ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" proves his astounding vocal control and versatility). Without his inimitable gyrations and astounding facial contortions, this would have been just another holiday film (albeit a gorgeous one), without a heart. And the fact that Carrey pulled off this tour de force weighed down by the uncomfortable and claustrophobic wardrobe and facial prostheses he endured for months, is a miracle in and of itself. He still managed to reveal every detailed nuance and humorous facial feature in this one-of-a-kind feature film, one that will never be repeated. With all of the bad holiday films that typically come our way this time of the year, this is one that will stand the test of time. It's certainly become one of my favorites, never failing to make me laugh out loud. It's drop dead funny, hilariously satirical for the adults, and equally entertaining for the kiddies, while never losing sight of it's objective—that Christmas is a time for redemption and joy—a very difficult feat to perform, indeed. Even more wise was the decision of Howard to clearly allow the singular humor of it's star to shine through, unencumbered, for the world to enjoy.","

","How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a family comedy based on book of the same title by Dr. Seuss. It was the first adaption to be a film feature. Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story as the Grinch. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates the story.The film is directed by Ron Howard.He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit.High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas.The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday.If a movie can unleash Jim Carrey at his finest, revamp the Grinch story, and still pay tribute to the legacy of Dr. Seuss, you can bet it qualifies as rousing entertainment.It is definitely a joy to watch.","

","If there's any Dr. Seuss related works, I'm going to do the reviews in rhyme. Every who down in Whoville loved Christmas a lot, but the Grinch who lives on Mt. Crumpet did not... wait a minute! Does this story sound familiar to you? Well, I have a feeling this is similar to the animated classic too. However, the plot in this movie has been dragged too long. And whoever got this movie made did it all wrong. The Grinch in the Animated classic was crafty as a fox, but this Grinch looked like he escaped from the loony box! All the whos in this movie have been portrayed as materialistic while the whos in the classic taught us a message that is somewhat realistic. The only good thing in the movie is the dog named Max(And if you don't believe me, send me a fax.) I liked Jim Carrey, but not as the Grinch. Would you believe that he lost his shtick in a pinch. All I can say is that this movie stinks(And not like shoving a ton of onions down the sink).","

","I am not a huge fan of cliché, commercial X-mas films, but I saw this movie when it first came out, purely out of love for Jim Carrey. I was NOT disappointed! Sure, it is in possession of a Hollywood ending, and a romantic back-story to boot, but I found this both hilarious and touching.Following the plot of the original cartoon and picture book by Dr. Seuss, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the tale of one Grinch, masterfully played by Carrey as the bitter but witty green man, and his loathing for Christmas and all it stands for. The film goes deeper into his past, explaining that he was constantly mocked for his bitter disposition and hairy face as a kid, but when he finally got into the Christmas spirit and crafted a homemade tree angel for his heart-throb, Martha May Whovier, everyone simply laughed at his gift's lack of sparkles and beauty. Ashamed and heartbroken, the Grinch fled to Mount Crumpit, his only purpose in life to despise the holidays and all the Whos who loved it. Of course, this leads to his dastardly and outrageous plot to steal all the presents on Christmas Eve, therefor stealing the meaning of Christmas.I personally think that the movie, while embellishing on plots and characters like the darling Cindy Lou Who, had a good point to make; sometimes it seems like the holidays are nothing but material grab-bags for huge industries who take the opportunity to sell heaps of cheap junk to parents who are willing to fight to the death for their spoiled children. The Christmas ideal that is this rain of worldly wealth (oh, and a little good cheer) is happiness is sold to folk every day through advertisements and TV specials, and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the perfect stab back at those commercial standards.While this underlying message might detract from the overall plot and script in some movies, I think this one found a good balance; the kids can still enjoy the juvenile jokes and slapstick, while the adults can giggle quietly at the adult humour and the message.Overall, I found this a wonderful movie, not just at Christmas time, but basically all throughout the year!","

Also, in my opinion, Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor Momsen) was a really cute little girl. In addition, another thing that makes this film worth seeing is Faith Hill's rendition of ""Where Are You Christmas?"" As a matter of fact, all the music is good.

","Maybe if the memory of the Dr. Suess/Chuck Jones/Boris Korloff original didn't loom so large in the memory one might be able to accept this version more readily.  The problem is you can't improve on perfection.  The real story is so hidden in the script it loses all it's impact:  ""Christmas day will always be, just as long as we have we.""

","This Seuss story is well-known and loved by all. But is this new version really necessary?The emotional and moral core of this film revolves around the question ""Is Christmas all about presents (which can be extended to encompass commercialism and gross consumerism) or friends and family?"" The warm feeling you get when the expected conclusion is drawn (and not very well) is muddled by the fact that you've just watched a $100 million juggernaut steamroll your emotional responses. How can you resist the cute little residents of Whoville? How can you avoid letting that ""warm feeling"" spur you on to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of Grinch(tm) -related items?There was a turning point in the career of Jim Carrey. That fork in the road was called ""The Cable Guy"". Instead of making movies that could push the envelope and his audience, he instead choose to push the high-water mark for the highest paid actors in Hollywood.There are some funny moments with Grinch and his dog alone in their cave. But you've probably already seen them on TV as part of the marketing campaign for this film.Jim Carrey's talent is literally buried in this film. Even Carrey's irrepressible mania cannot claw its way out from under three hours worth of makeup.If you aren't taking a seven-year-old, don't go see this movie. Even if you are, I would suggest reading the book or watching the cartoon Grinch instead.","

This is not Dr. Suess' How The Grinch Stole Christmas AT ALL. This is Jim Carrey in elaborate make-up improvising and acting like, well, Jim Carrey. The script was extremely weak, at times I questioned if there was one, and the jokes were horrible one-liners (see Arnold's performance in the Batman Series). To say the least, I will not see this film again.  One word: Terrible. ***/10","

","The same way massive marketing schemes have turned Christmas into a big shopping fest, Hollywood has succeeded in turning a wonderful old heartfelt story into a giant Jim Carrey showcase.  If there was as much substance to the story-telling in this as there was substance to the extravagant scenery, it might have been worth watching.  I do, or did, have some respect for Jim. He does tend to put his heart into his roles, and there were moments, when I did feel like I was looking into the eyes of that old green cartoon character.  However, a few less sarcastic one-liners might have been a bit less distracting.  Overall, I feel that this is yet another Hollywood rip-off.  A wonderful old story, with a clear lesson to teach, poisoned by sarcastic one-liners causing endless distraction.  In future, when I want to help bring on the Christmas spirit, I'll rely on a good old time-tried tradition, the original.","

","Very, very, very badly made film indeed. Ron Howard's direction is totally wanton and gutless. The cinematographer obviously thought that if the camera went squint for about.99.9999% of the film it would mean that he was being creative. A little note to all: diagonal camera shots do not make good photography. It looks moronically awful.The art and set design is cheap too. Everything is way too close together and cramped looking. You cannot really make anything out at all. And in some shots you can see the roof of the sound-stage. I reckon about $50 in total was spent on production design.Half the film was pointless effects that did nothing for me. They did not make the film look magical. No, they certainly did not. The Whos look really stupid too. What on earth are they supposed to be? They look like the Beagle Boys from Duck Tales. To sum it up in 2 words they look 'totally ridiculous'. In the scene where the Grinch shaves the Mayor's head.why do they start screaming and running away? That whole scene was the worst directing I have ever scene. I know that this is a kid's movie and, believe me, there were many kids in the audience. There were hardly a couple of laughs among them.The type of humor in this film is the kind that expects you to laugh when someone walks into a lamppost or falls into a custard pie. Come on. This is the 21st century and we're STILL getting this trash that passes itself of as a movie?Not even the hugely talented Carrey can save this steaming pile of trash. I don't think anyone could. He simply is NOT funny. You'd think that playing the Grinch would be a role he could twist and manipulate. But no, it's a kiddie's movie. So he just acts stupid without being funny. The cartoon is way better. I suggest you watch that instead.","

The only thing I found weird about it is that it had all the things in the movie in a snowflake they had humans decorations creatures in a snowflake.

","I grew up watching the Boris Karloff animated version of this story and enjoyed it a lot. I was concerned that too much would be added to the original, but I thought most of what was new here added something. It was toward the middle of the movie that flashbacks showed how the Grinch came to be so mean, though we didn't get to see a lot of detail about how his isolation became so permanent. And no one explained how the Grinch became such a brilliant inventor living in a cave by himself. Where he got all the parts for his gadgets, of course, was simple--he lived near where Whoville dumped its trash.The movie's best performances came from Jim Carrey and Taylor Momsen when they were together. Taylor did an outstanding job by herself as Cindy Lou, who had to be quite a bit older, with her role greatly expanded in this version. I wish I could say the same for Carrey, whose movies I have enjoyed for some time. But he was quite good at times. He perfectly captured the evil grin the Grinch showed in the book and cartoon (though part of that was makeup, I'm sure). And he showed that the Grinch may not have been that evil after all. Still, Boris Karloff did the Grinch better as a truly evil creature.I enjoyed it when this movie attempted to duplicate the cartoon and the book, though without Thurl Ravenscroft (best known as Tony the Tiger) to sing ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"", that song lacked something. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job narrating, and I don't think Karloff could have done any better himself. The dog was good too: we were constantly reminded of his talent during commercials because he is now on 'Complete Savages' on ABC. I have to question whether Carrey needed quite so much makeup: maybe the creature could have been more human. But the makeup was well done.Christine Baranski did an okay job as a Martha Stewart type who was always competing with Cindy Lou's mother in decorating her house. There was an interesting scene where a cannon was used to put up decorations. Visual effects such as these were quite enjoyable.I thought I was finally going to find out the lyrics to that song the Whos sang on Christmas morning. There seemed to be some disagreement over those lyrics, which was funny.The movie offers two lessons about the true meaning of Christmas. One was new for this movie--Cindy Lou's charitable attitude. The other ...SPOILERS HERE IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK OR WATCH THE CARTOON... was the Grinch's realization of the fact Christmas didn't depend on presents. And the reaction of the Whos to the Grinch's deeds made more sense when shown in detail.The Grinch had more reason to be in a foul mood at Christmas in this version, of course. I thought those scenes were great where he was being honored but embarrassed after Cindy Lou persuaded the town to accept him just before the big day.The scenes of the Grinch returning to Whoville after his change of heart were very exciting, with some new twists.","

","Throughout THE GRINCH I laughed one (1) time, at a throwaway joke about a cash bar. But, generally, this is probably the worst holiday movie I've seen (well, maybe it's not quite as boring as TRAPPED IN PARADISE). I kept getting distracted:-Why did some characters have snouts but others didn't?-Correct me if I'm wrong, but did the Grinch Have Two Mommies?-The movie's secular worldview. Are there no churches in Whoville? Much was said about the true meaning of Christmas, but no mention of the birth of Christ. I'm not religious, but do acknowledge the birth of Christ.-And, speaking of, are there no Jews? I'm awaiting the sequel, HOW THE MESHUGGA STOLE HANUKKAH.-Are there other towns in the snowflake? Is that where the Jews reside, or did they move to the Whoville equivalent of Florida - in the drop of a hurricane's rain?-Why was the visual texture so fuzzy and indistinct, the sets so creepy and unpleasant? Isn't this supposed to be a kiddie movie? -Why didn't the little girl recognize the Grinch in the Santa outfit? Was she stricken with blindness during that scene, or just stupidity?There are other points I've already forgotten, but the biggest thing I hated was the general message. So, someone who hates Christmas is automatically a freak who should be pitied. Guess that makes me one, too.","

","This film is a lot better than it should be, mainly thanks to Jim Carry. Seriously, Jim Carry does not get enough credit for whatever reason but anyway; this film is based off of the classic yarn of the same name. You know what I am getting at and I am too lazy to do a full review for this but there is one thing about the film that rubbed me the wrong way, the very noticeable lack of diversity when it came to the actors, both leads and extras. I did not even notice it until the character of the Grinch made a racially charged joke. But finally at the end of the film I noticed a few actors of color; I am guessing the producers of the film noticed the problem and filmed an extra scene or something.","

","Here we have a holiday classic ruined.
 The original story was a display of someone who is an outcast from the mainstream because he does not, for some unknown reason, can't relate to his neighbors. So thinking that he can not fit in decides to ruin their fun so they will feel as bad as him at this time of year. As his plans come to fruition, to destroy their holiday, he realizes that the holiday is not about material things and thus gains happiness for himself and others.
 In this remake FORGET IT. Now we are surrounded by the most evil, vile and duplicitous race of things (think a race social climbing insects) whose only though is ""How can I show I'm better than you"". 
 This time we are given a history why the Grinch is a self imposed outcast, because of a bad childhood trauma, this is a nice touch. From this point on the film goes down hill and fast. Every person you meet is only acting for their self interest. What can I do to show how much better I am than everybody around me. Quite frankly if I was to go to this town and was around these people, even for a short time, I would get out of town as fast as the Grinch had. The only saving grace is little Cindy, the incorruptible child. Who sees the good in all and in the end helps all in the end come together.
 This film is a complete disaster, with the exception of filming some of the animated sequences in live action. 
 Skip it and watch the original animated TV show or better still read the book with your kids.","

However, these additions, noted below, to the story line made me miffed and was definitely not appreciated resulting in the 5/10 star rating. 1.) Implied Adultery: I couldn't believe the Grinch was noted to possibly have come from his mother's an adulterous affair. 2.) Lying: having the politician lying in public is probably a truism to be noted from real world but in a Dr. Suess novel it seems shameful for that character to lie to Cindy Lou Who even though he is a politician and that is expected behavior from a politician. 3.) Stealing: having one of the Whos portrayed as a thief was just over the top slap in the face. I also missed the part from the original animation where the dog pulls the sleigh. I am sure p.e.t.a. would not have appreciated a real dog doing that stunt, but it was one of my most favored action sequences of the original movie and I missed it.","

","How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Jim Carrey, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, Molly Shannon, Bill Irwin: We are all curious as to how the Grinch accomplishes his mission on the most giving time of year but from what I can gather, the only thing he truly stole was my admission fee. He is rejected from a small village and lives in the mountains. We are never given any back story as to what his parents were like. Instead we are given a lame pelican explanation that just seems tacked on. The villagers also have snouts, which I never fully understood and probably never will. Plot regards his stealing away Christmas and having a change of heart. While it may mirror the classic holiday animation, it still comes off as artificial. Interesting directing choice for Ron Howard who is known for films such as Apollo 13 and The Paper. While his attempt is praise worthy, the payoff is nowhere near as entertaining as the animated film. Jim Carrey is the ideal choice to play the Grinch but without any background, it just comes off as a really good impression. Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor and Molly Shannon are given the embarrassing tasks of sporting snouts and lame lines of dialogue. The Grinch costume passes but art direction is artificial and about as festive as your average toy store. Perhaps the Grinch should have stole the screenplay. Score: 3 / 10","

","I first watched this movie some years ago. My wife told me that I hated it. During the years since I have learned much about trauma and the resultant impact on those who have suffered from trauma. It is blatantly clear that if a young life is rejected and unloved, there is a significant impact on that victim. I have read so much about how this story is about the spirit of Christmas but from my viewpoint it is a story about how a society cannot tolerate a person who is different to them. They scorn, they reject and push a person away. This generates anger in the recipient, imposed by that rejection.That a young girl identifies the Grinch's vulnerability is a view of a compassionate mind. She understands his vulnerability and seeks to heal. While the Grinch has become accustomed to being rejected he, himself, does not understand either until she encourages him to return the Christmas gifts to the village and, at the same time, exposes the village mayor as a self centered  err arseThe story, whether realised by Ron Howard or not, is a tale of our current society that cares more about protecting ourselves and rejecting others that are less fortunate. It demonstrates our own vulnerabilities.","

","For all those who cherish the holiday season, there are many for whom it is worse than high treason. To understand all of those grumps, it's a cinch - just turn to dear Seuss' tale of the Grinch. But how to redo the cartoon classic, while avoiding a scornful mess most tragic? It seems that Ron Howard has deduced the way to make the Grinch shine in the modern day.He treats the source text with reverence and care, and set, props, and costumes beyond compare. The zany, wild energy makes perfect sense, with consumerist critique to amuse the parents. The obnoxious Whos are pristinely portrayed, with prosthetics and quirks to assuage the dismayed. Colourful, dazzling, a true privilege - The Grinch is still a Christmas film with an edge. To add depth to his lead and expand the story, Howard adds a childhood of woe most sorry And while a romance subplot may feel quite forced, it's maudlin enough to not feel too outsourced.But the real fun begins with our titular lout, whose charisma alone makes the film stand out. Jim Carrey's at his manic, contorting best; his wild riffs and improv are masterful jest. As the holiday hoopla verges on annoying, Carrey's WC Fields grumblings save it from cloying. Buried underneath a mound of green yak hair, Carrey mines pathos to ensure that you care. With his own (stellar) theme song and sickly Grinch smile, Carrey's at his most fun when flamboyantly vile. And for priceless one-liners to leave you reeling, look no further than Carrey's histrionic ""I'm...FEELING!"" And the second half setpiece, the great Christmas heist, is thrilling enough to fit modern zeitgeist. But for all of its flamboyant affectations, Howard's film warns against skewed expectations. The film finds its core with its sole doubting Who - precious Taylor Momsen owns Cindy, it's true. With gleaming eyes and screen presence triumphant, Momsen's charm helps make her song less redundant. As the piece's true villain, Jeffrey Tambour's superb, making his preening mayor a classic Christmas turd.It's rare to find a film so energetic - perfect tonally without seeming mimetic. Infectious sentiment with consumer critique: as a Christmas film, The Grinch is wholly unique. Steered by the serene tones of Anthony Hopkins, this Grinch is one live action update that wins. With wild laughs and no aesthetic compromises, Howard and Carrey will make hearts grow three sizes. For prime holiday fun without saccharine bliss dross... slide into the snowflake where Carrey Stole Christmas!-8.5/10","

","I rarely review a film that has more than 100 reviewers, but I'm going to make an exception here.I think it's brilliant! Most who really like it give the highest marks to Jim Carrey. But I'm going to give most of the credit to Ron Howard. It occurred to me while watching this that Ron Howard is one director who has contributed an unusually diverse body of work to American cinema. Everything from ""Cocoon"" to ""Willow"" to ""Parenthood"" to ""Backdraft"" to ""Far And Away"" to ""Apollo 13"" to ""A Beautiful Mind"" to ""The Davinci Code"" to ""Frost/Nixon"" to his current tale about ""Moby Dick"". The question with the Grinch film was how to make it relevant to adults, while still keeping the moral of the Suess story..and although it's nothing like the book, it does maintain that moral.And then there's Jim Carrey. Who else could have handled this role? No one. I couldn't help but wonder how much of his performance was scripted and how much was ad-lib.The special effects -- absolutely outstanding. The makeup -- remarkable. And all wrapped up in a film that is truly unique.I was interested to seen Christine Baranski (""The Good Wife"") here. Somehow I missed that Anthony Hopkins was narrator.For balance, watch this film, George C. Scott's ""A Christmas Carol"" and Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"".","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3372402/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw3372402,5," Very flawed but visually charming
","While not perfect, Ron Howard's Dr. Seuss's How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a dazzling blast of elaborate sensory overload and wildly inventive Christmas set decoration that it succeeds in whisking you along for its weird and wonderful tale pretty darn well. Howard's decision to go the live action route as opposed to animation was admirable, as it more than likely resulted in a much more daunting undertaking. The star of the film is the set design, starting with the quaint blueprint of Seuss's beloved book, and piling on decadent, surreal spectacle until we are presented with a world where every corner of every frame is a giddily cluttered piece of eye candy and raucous auditory nuttiness. Starting with the Grinch's lair on snow laden Mount Crumpet, a garbage encrusted haven of rickety inventions and off kilter lighting, to the loopy, majestically over the top town of Whoville in the valley below, every set piece is so overdone and buzzing with creative energy it boggles the senses. In that sense, the film succeeds glowingly. Now, on to the makeup. It's my only gripe with the film and one I can't get over no matter how much I try and look past it. This excludes the Grinch himself of course, they did a wonderful job with him, which I'll get to in a minute. The other Whovians, though, look slightly terrifying, and the decision to try and exactly recreate the way Seuss drew their characteristics, mayyy not have been the best idea. Little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) looks alright, but her dad Lou (Bill Irwin, the voice of TARS from Interstellar) and some of the other adults look very unsettling with their eerily upturned noses and clay set grins, like a drunk plastic surgeon had his way with them using only a cookie cutter. Then there's the baby Grinch.. Who I think was supposed to be cute, but ends up looking like something that a Mogwai would have a nightmare about. It's all in good fun though, and doesn't hurt the film too much, just a quibble I have. When one steps back and admires the movie as a whole, the positives outweigh the negatives. Jim Carrey must be commended for letting another funny, hyperactive performance shine through pounds of makeup plastered all over his face and figure. He never loses that spark that makes his presence so unique, and although great amounts of new dialogue and interaction that weren't in the book have been added, especially with his character, he still manages to retain that 'Seussy' outlook and vernacular (something that The Cat In The Hat failed miserably at, Mike Myers being the chief culprit). Carrey even adds poignancy to the Grinch's delicate, near manic balancing act of bitterness and hate, with a sweetness clawing to get out. That dynamic could have been suppressed into childlike simplicity, but he plays him at an adult level, to the film's advantage. The supporting cast is cool too, showcasing Jeffrey Tambor as the town's smarmy Mayor, Christine Baranski as foxy Martha May Whovier as well as Mindy Sterling, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Bryce Dallas Howard, Q'orianka Kilcher, Verne Troyer and a kindly Anthony Hopkins as the unseen narrator, the only person who gets to speak actual passages from the book. My favourite moment? The tiny, pint sized Who's driving around in their little football sized car. It's oddball little quirks that make the movie work and are its strong suits; a warm, weird sense of humour and endlessly creative visual palette that amp up the Christmas cheer dial to eleven.","

","An entertaining family film. How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a good movie , what is most noticeable is the appearance. the Oscar nominated Production and Costume Design is great. The Oscar-winning makeup looks fantastic. The Cinematography by the late Donald Peterman is clever and inventive. The film is big , colorful and fun. Jim Carrey is in top gives an excellent performance. What is not as good is the script by Who Framed Roger Rabbit writers Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. It has funny jokes. But not a good plot the backstory for the Grinch was unnecessary and not especially original. And i don't like the message. In the book and the original Christmas special ""Try to be more like the who'sin your view of Christmas."" In the film it is ""Don't be like this in your view of Christmas."" It is the difference between someone which gives a good advice on how to be and someone saying what shouldn't do. In the end is still a film that the whole family should sit down and watch at Christmas. It may lack in story. But it makes up for it in visuals and in Jim Carry's performance and there are worse children's films to see like Ulvesommer.","

","Jim Carrey is really fun, though his canon does include some clunkers. I really wanted to like this film, but with all the bells and whistles and Carrey's mugging, it just got dull. Because it is from the Grinch's perspective, the events seem cruel. The humor is juvenile and unoriginal. It has that anything-for-a-laugh being to it. What carries it to a point is that it is a good story. But it is not enough. I guess when someone does a sequel, even if it is a feature film updating a cartoon, it needs to take it to the next level, to put some new and original spin on it. I'm not even saying it's terrible; I give it a six. But a few days after seeing it, I really took nothing with me.","

","The bottom line is that Jim Carrey made this film. Jim Carrey and the special effects that is. Jim Carrey as the Grinch could not have been a better fit! The special-effects and the looks of who Ville are spot on! Also Christine Baranski is perfect for Martha May! She really nailed her performance. And then you have Molly Shannon, who was very enjoyable here. The movie's script is OK it's not great but it suffices. Really all you have to know about this movie is that it's family-friendly and it's fun to watch at Christmas time, especially with young kids. It's also very family-friendly unless you are offended by a little crude humor. If you don't want to see that, or you don't want your kids to see that just beware that it's in there. Overall the Grinch is an enjoyable film with stunning visuals. That Oscar win was well deserved! 7/10 for the Grinch.","

","I don't get why this only has a 6.0/10 rating. Despite a few corny elements, this live action adaption of the most famous Seuss classic is not only a wonderful Christmas film, it's a comedic gem. This in my opinion is one of Jim Carrey's best films, he is so darn funny and a comic genius. The film is obviously big-budget, but it works tremendously, especially the set design and the hairstyles of the Who's. It has a lot of humorous dialogue, and you don't catch it all until you see it a few times. The soundtrack is great, the acting is good, the scenery is spectacular. The storyline sticks to the original, and adds a lot of new elements, such as The Grinch's family backstory, a young girl who befriends him, and the evil Mayor of Whoville. I see this movie at least once if not twice every Christmas season, and it's just as great each time.","

","How the Grinch stole Christmas isn't great, but it's still enjoyable. Most of it comes from Jim Carrey, who steals every scene he's in as THE GRINCH! The girl who plays Cindy Lou is actually pretty decent, as with all of the actors in this film. The sets are pretty creative, so are the costumes, and the Grinch's makeup is pretty cool.Here are the downsides of this film: While the Grinch's makeup is spectacular, the Who's makeup are more creepy than cute. Also, some of the characters like Martha May and the Mayor of Whoville seem a little uninteresting and a little forced. Plus, some of the cinematography in this film is poorly handled. It's constantly moving and so you don't get to enjoy the sets as much as you want to. Finally, when the Grinch is stealing the presents, it feels like it's fast forwarding towards the end. That whole scene should have been a little slower and should've had played the ""You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch."" song in it.But all in all, the movie is still enjoyable even if it has problems. While the original cartoon is better than the live-action film, I still recommend it to people who love Jim Carrey, because he has a ton of fun in this film. Is it good? No, but it's not bad. It's a guilty pleasure.","

","I think the Grinch role is perfect for Jim Carrey's style -- overact and ham it up (when he's doing comedies at least). I have come to enjoy that from him. The Grinch story Dr Seuss wrote is genius. But there are plenty of praises already written among the 450 user reviews of this film published here. I had trouble with the middle part. Cindy Lou feels for him and invites him to town to receive an award. I don't think this was in the original story and the disaster that arises from this scene spoils a lot of the film for me. After getting a trophy and some praise, he is force-fed food and drink that he clearly doesn't like or want. His arms are nowhere to be seen and I have to assume that he is being restrained so he can't push the food away. It goes on for five minutes at least. At the lowest point in this torture, he has a tube jammed in his mouth and is force- fed such a huge quantity of liquid that he almost explodes. I found this unfunny. I found it repulsive and sick. That's no way to ""honor"" anyone. The Grinch reacts by throwing things around and calling them names and finishes by burning up their town tree. His anger is justified. What is Ron Howard trying to tell us? That the town that teased him as a kid still has a sadistic streak? That was never Dr. Seuss' message. For one thing it justifies his next act which is to steal Christmas. I think, therefor that it is a flaw in the film. It's still a good story. If one forgets that center lapse one can enjoy the rest of the film. It has a touching message: Christmas is in the heart.","

","With such an iconic 1966 animated 1/2 hour special, it's hard to imagine a reason to reimagine it as a live action movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works. Nothing can change that.","

","It's quite odd how we can enjoy a movie so much when we are a kid, yet find so many flaws and face-palms once we watch that very same film again as adults. Ron Howard's remake (or re-imagining) of Dr. Seuss's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is one of the best examples of a film I adored as a child, yet find many little problems with it now, at the age of nineteen. One of my best, most faint memories of my passed Christmases was my amazing grandfather taking me to the theatres to see this movie. I was excited because I knew the old short, and even owned it on VHS. My grandfather was excited to see more Jim Carrey comedy. We had a grand old time, I must say. To this day, we still have a spot in our hearts for this soft-hearted little film. Most people consider the greatest films on the planet are the ones that take us out of our lives and place us in a world that we've never experienced before. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is my favorite example of such a film.An unexplained green creature, called the Grinch, hates Christmas for the solo fact that it brings back the worst memories, which--in turn--made him the bitter, lonesome thing that he is. When on the parole to wreak a few mishaps in the town of Whoville before Christmas, he meets--and saves, as a matter of fact--a young girl named Cindy Lou. Cindy sees the good in the Grinch. Cindy believes that ALL people have good in them, but can sometimes be driven to bitterness through careless actions by others. This sets the film into motion, with Cindy Lou trying to get the Grinch to join the little place known as Whoville for a big, wonderful holiday bash.To begin, I must immediately state a major bravo for Ron Howard, for he has accomplished such a notable film for the Christmas season. As I have stated: there isn't many movies that take you into another world completely. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" succeeds phenomenally at that. Ron Howard's directing is excellent, with all the set designs extremely well-crafted and suitable for Whoville. Even the mountain the Grinch lives in looks fantastic.In this film, Jim Carrey gives one of the most amazing performances in history. From what I've heard, he had an enormously hard time dealing with the suit, claiming it was extremely painful and hard to move around in whilst wearing (take notes Christian Bale). Not only is he hilarious, but he even gets the emotional moments of the film down so well that you cannot help but be moved a little on the inside. When you see hope on the Grinch's face, it truly touches you. Another bravo to Jim. Another standout was Anthony Hopkins as the narrator. Anthony gives a fantastic reading for the film, and definitely adds his own charm to it. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I can't say too much. Every role besides the Grinch and Cindy Lou were tiny, partial roles, so many of the other performances just weren't too extravagant. Cindy Lou was played by a seven- or eight-year-old, so you have to let her bad moments slide a little. This young girl plays a fine role, for the most part, and even has her very own moments that considerably warm your heart. The one character arch I thought was a little pestering was the slutty Martha May. Dear Father in Heaven, let her hang from Wholimbs upon Whotrees within Whoville.The writing is very interesting, in my opinion. Many, many subplots were added to the old, simplistic, thirty-something-page story to make it a nearly two-hour-long film. Besides the irritability of Martha May, I found other characters more of a necessity for this expanded version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". The jokes, for the most part, are only funny because Jim Carrey breathes a LOT of life into them. I laughed aloud many times, that much is true. Jim really knows what he is doing. He also plays off of the other characters very well, like with the ""Cheermeister"" sequence. No matter what others tell you, there is a heart underneath this mass of skit-like comedy. Think of it as you do untangling the Christmas tree lights for decorating; it may be a bundle of mess, but giving it time lets you learn to appreciate it.The soundtrack has to be mentioned! I consider ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" to be a fantasy film, in a way. This soundtrack helps develop the tone and atmosphere so well, and I think it is a major plus the film has going for it.Overall, many people will be divided on this little Christmas candy, but I am definitely for it. It could be that I grew up with it. Nostalgia tends to grasp me when it comes to me reviewing movies. However, I don't think it is just that. I see a genuine attempt at a warming film underneath the bundle of story and characters. My score for Ron Howard's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a seven-out-of-ten stars. It it fun, but I do enjoy the original much, much more.Merry Christmas, and God bless!","

It's always fun to watch this time of year. The insight into the Grinch isn't the only good thing about this movie.

","Imagine Entertainment forgot this was supposed to be a kid's movie that adults could enjoy; a quality found in Walt Disney's classic films. The film is too long and loses its magic when it strays from the Dr. Seuss book: ""Who"" cares about the Grinch's schooldays or that he has an aversion to shaving? (Or has a girlfriend?) The ""Holiday Cheermeister"" scene is just plain stupid and seems to go on forever. (It's boring.)Many things in this film are not appropriate for children: 1. The Grinch eats a glass bottle, tortures himself, hits his head and throws a tantrum like a 3-year-old. 2. He dresses like a test dummy and hurls himself into a cement wall. 3. A giant ""toy monkey"" that looks like a sick Batman film prop. 4. ""Max"" the little dog kisses the mayor's butt. 5. Force-feeding the Grinch ""Christmas goodies"" such as pudding and fruitcake. 6. A who-girl with cleavage and sultry clothes. 7. The use of the word ""bitching"" in a kid's movie? 8. The Grinch's nightmarish face and those abominable who-noses. The use of a ""soft filter"" presumably to provide a dream-like quality or make the make-up look better makes the film hard on the eyes and creates video scanning problems. The colors look ""soft and weak"" and details are ""fuzzy"". (The ""Macrovision"" anti-copy filter sure doesn't help the film's sharpness.)On a smaller screen, it plays much better. The make-up is not as scary when the faces aren't 8-feet wide. Thankfully, with disc chapters, you can edit this film for your personal taste or for a much younger audience. (Yes, it's called censoring.)The beginning plays well through the decorating and holiday shopping, then cut to the ""Grinch Song"" and the last third where he takes and returns all the presents and carves the Roast Beast. Touches of genius abound in this otherwise uneven production: The ""Whos"" live on a snowflake instead of a speck of dust. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as the narrator. The sets look just like the Dr. Seuss drawings. The new songs are excellent and the classic songs are also featured. Faith Hill belts-out a great ""Where Are You Christmas?"" Taylor Momsen ""steals"" the movie as the incredibly adorable ""Cindy Lou Who."" I Just down-graded my rating to a ""7"" after a recent viewing in 2013. I dislike (hate?) the middle part of the film. What doesn't follow the exact ""Dr. Seus"" storyline truly stinks. It is not a children's film. It is better suited for ages 10+ and Jim Cary fans.Consumer's note: The DVD copy comes in a paper sleeve in the Blu-Ray box, making it impossible to keep it scratch-free. That's so cheap.","

","Ten years later, and I finally see this once over-hyped movie. The common theme with the banter about this movie was usually that ""I can see Jim Carey"" in the Grinch. In fact, there is little to no Carey, it's almost all Grinch. What I mean is the way that they made the Grinch a real thing truly did the story justice. They focused on the story, not the special effects - they didn't lose any of the whimsy in the process. You will feel for the Grinch, you will feel like you are in Whoville, and you will feel the true spirit of giving at Christmas.I really enjoyed the movie, it is simply adorable. I don't think they could have done a better job with it. This is an instant Christmas classic.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2534498/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw2534498,5," Not so impressed with this version anymore
","I first saw this full-length live action adaptation of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" (one of the many classic children's books that Dr. Seuss is remembered for) in late 2001, the year after its theatrical run. I was a teenager at the time, and remembered the book and the 1966 animated TV special very well from my childhood. I definitely was impressed with my first viewing of this live action film the first time I saw it, and it didn't seem to wear thin with subsequent viewings, even though I certainly didn't find it to be nearly as good as the cartoon. This Christmas season, I have revisited both the 1966 short and this 2000 full-length movie. I still think that classic TV special is a little gem, like so many others do, but this version is far from it.Inside a snowflake, there is a town called Whoville, and in this town, everybody loves Christmas. Just outside their town, up on Mount Crumpet, lives a bitter hermit known as the Grinch, and his dog, Max. The Grinch hates Christmas and is greatly feared by the Whos. However, Cindy Lou Who, a little girl in Whoville who feels that the true meaning of Christmas is missing in the town with all the materialism she's seeing around her, is curious about this despised creature that lives up on that mountain. She asks other Whos who once knew the Grinch what they remember about him, and learns a lot about how he became the hateful individual he now is. Feeling that everyone should be together for the holiday, and that this creature can change, she then attempts to befriend the Grinch, inviting him down to Whoville for the Whobilation. Thanks to her, he has been nominated the Cheer Meister for this event. Will Cindy Lou Who's plan work?One reason why I don't care much for this version is Jim Carrey's portrayal of the Grinch. During my latest viewing, I couldn't keep a straight face through ALL his antics, unlike when I watched Carrey in ""Batman Forever"", but for the most part, he's still not funny here. I also found the characters in general here to be bland and not so likable, especially the nasty Mayor Augustus May Who, who can be perhaps a little annoying at times. I also think the flashback sequence showing the Grinch as a baby is a notable weak segment, with the ""Santa, bye-bye"" and such, and that's certainly not the only one. Basically, I just found the movie overall to be deeply flawed in a number of departments, and totally lacking the charm of the 1966 short. There are some mildly amusing moments, as well as some occasional touching ones, plus the visuals are very impressive and I can't complain much about Anthony Hopkins' narration, but these things are not enough to make up for the lack of heart in this adaptation. Not EVERYTHING fails here, but unfortunately, the vast majority of it does.This polarizing live action version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" led to the making of another live action full-length adaptation of a classic Dr. Seuss book, ""The Cat in the Hat"", and that film's reception was generally very negative, which is understandable! The third full-length movie based one a Dr. Seuss story was 2008's ""Horton Hears a Who!"", this time not a live action film but a computer animated one. I said in my review of that film that it was PROBABLY the best of the full-length Dr. Seuss adaptations so far, but now I'm going to have to take that back and say it's DEFINITELY the best of the three! Clearly, live action doesn't work so well with these Dr. Seuss classics. It's been eight years since the release of the ""Cat in the Hat"" movie, and it seems there's still no sign of another live action Seuss film coming, which isn't a bad thing. I don't know how the upcoming CGI ""Lorax"" adaptation will turn out, but at the moment, I can say the ""Horton Hears a Who!"" adaptation is the only good one of these previous movies. This version of Dr. Seuss' Christmas story is not as bad as its 2003 follow-up, but was still unnecessary, and I would say you're better off sticking with the classic TV special to put you in the Christmas spirit.","

","After the 1966 Animated short people were in there offices wondering if they could turn this holiday classic into a live action movie. Did they Succede? The film is about The Grinch played by Jim Carrey who lives right next to Whoville and hates it when they celebrate Christmas. So he comes up with a plan like in the original to put on a Santa suit and steal Christmas once and for all. But a little girl Cindy Lou Who played by Taylor Momsen tries to show him just how great Christmas is.This is a actually a really entertaining film with Jim Carrey providing some great material. The effects are really good, The little girl is adorable and the supporting cast like Jeffery Tambor, Molly Shannon and Christine Baranski provide some great material to. Well Did they Succede/ I like to think so. I say Check it out.Rated PG For Some Crude Humor.1hr 45min/105min.****/****","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2529162/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw2529162,8," Truth Be Told... I Like It
","Ron Howard's interpretation of Dr. Seuss' classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" retells it in a sort of modern way. It draws a lot of influences from both the original book and the classic short from Chuck Jones.The basic premise is the same, the creatures called Whos all love Christmas, but The Grinch does not so he tries to ruin it by taking all the decorations and presents away. But there are a lot of tweaks they did to expand the story. This movie goes into detail of The Grinch's past, as a child he had a crush on a young girl Who and tried to impress her during Christmastime. But all the other kids laugh at him causing him to eventually snap and take out all of his aggression on the holiday. Not the best origin but it could've been a lot worse.We also get a sort of contest the Whos do every year at Christmas called Whovalation, which Cindy Lou invites the Grinch to. Without giving too much away(for those select few who haven't seen the movie yet)these scenes can either be viewed as a interesting interpretation of the original story or be seen as a blatant attempt to make the movie longer than an hour. In fact the Grinch doesn't don his infamous disguise and steal the presents until the movie is thirty minutes from finished.This movie is either a hit or miss for most people. For me, I thought for what it was it was a pretty good movie. Sure they could've toned down the adult humor(compared to Cat in the Hat though, it's nothing)but they did manage to capture the spirit of the book by the end of it. Jim Carrey does an acceptable performance of The Grinch while giving his own comedic flair into the character(which again is hit or miss). The rest of the supporting cast does well to give the movie a unique feel. The visuals of Whoville and Mt. Crumpit are very pretty and feels just like a live action Dr. Seuss book.Overall this may not be a movie everyone can enjoy but if you take it with a grain of salt and get past some of the crude humor you might have a good time with it. I've liked it ever since I was a kid and it continues to be a guilty pleasure.","

I will only go as far as saying that if it Christmas and you are home with the family,pull up a chair,pour yourself a glass of beer and enjoy one of the best Christmas movies made for a long time. They entire cinematography of this movie was spot on and was full of colours that remind you xmas. Jim Carey nails his role and makes it even more enjoyable.On other hand if its not Christmas and you watch this it wont have the same warming effect it can have.

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2353054/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw2353054,5," It deserved the ""Razzie"" award for worst script...
","A lot of money was spent in turning this Ron Howard production into a full-length feature with JIM CARREY as ""The Grinch,"" but I'll take the 1966 animated version any day over this overstuffed fantasy.The director obviously gave Carrey license to ""go for it"" with some moments of comedy enough to produce a few chuckles, but Carrey's lack of restraint reaches manic proportions before the film is half over and his sickly green and grotesque make-up is an unappetizing sight to behold in those huge close-ups. The film (at all times) strains too hard to be a quirky imitation of the original Dr. Seuss cartoon and is simply not up to the job. It's a mess. Furthermore, none of the supporting characters are more than mildly entertaining. TAYLOR MOMSEN is a lovely little girl but she can't sing and she substitutes a look of placid, wide-eyed wonder for acting while Carrey heats up the screen with his overacted mugging. CHRISTINE BARANSKI has a flair for comedy but she's been seen to much better advantage in other roles and looks more than mildly uncomfortable as the woman secretly in love with ""The Grinch."" Actually, most of the time she looks as though she can barely tolerate looking at him.There's a perky background score, some over-luxurious sets, some ghastly looking costumes for the Whoville residents, and the overall feeling one gets is that the slim plot has been expanded to the point where it overstays its welcome. The over stuffing doesn't just apply to the sets and costumes and special effects. The script tries to set up a flashback of ""how"" the Grinch became what he is, but it has a dulling effect that only succeeds in slowing down the ponderous pace of the film's last hourThe script rightfully won a ""Razzie"" as worst of the year, so the blame can't be placed entirely on director or star. My advice: If you want to do justice to Dr. Seuss, do it with animation and not live actors.Summing up: Not a shred of charm. It's as if ""Opie"" meets Tim Burton.","

I looked forward to this as I love the 1966 cartoon so much my holiday season doesn't start until I've seen it however I won't be holding this title to that regard. It's the usual mix big budget Hollywood updates; we have Ron Howard at the helm trying desperately for a blockbuster, Jim Carrey almost manic in his attempt at comedy and a shamefully long-winded script.

","The story was dull, boring, wandering. My 5 year old and I had watched the original the day before. Loved it, this was lame. Had to bribe him to watch it. For one, there was too much padding applied to the original story to make it into a full length movie. The glitz was distracting, the build up as to why the Grinch was grinchy was long and unneeded, the side stories weakened the main plot (ex: the hikers climbing up the Grinch's mountain, the mayor's competing love interest, house decoration contest, the Grinch winning the award...) The reviews are much more positive than the overall rating. I think the rating is a more accurate indicator. Perhaps people who don't like a movie are less inclined to spend time writing ten lines about it than those who do.","

","Jim Carrey is a comic genius. I know some folks find his shtick creepy, I don't. If you love Carreys style you'll love him in this movie, and I think he pretty much nails the title character on the head. Unfortunately Ron Howard and the screen writers are way off the mark with the rest of the movie. Anyone who has read the original Seuss story or watched the 60's cartoon understand the who's are a selfless fun loving race as opposed to the Grinch who is mean for meanness sake ""No one quite knows the reason"" Is the quote in the written work that describes him. But here the who's aren't the lovable diminutive creatures from the book, instead they resemble deformed humans and they are a mean spirited shallow lot, who celebrate Christmas for all the wrong reasons. As spiteful as the Grinch is he is at least honest about who he is and you almost root for him to destroy whoville and swipe all the presents from those snotty jerks! Add to that the unsettling camera work and visuals that depict whoville as not a happy little town but a carnival from a nightmare. So despite Carreys strong performance I can not recommend this movie. Read the book or re watch the Karloff cartoon again instead.","

I feel an hour would have been plenty for this film. The music was also a bit much for children. I understand that movies these days have adult references to keep parents interested but I feel there are hardly any movies just for kids anymore. Having said this, Carrey pulls off almost a Faegen-gone-mad character from Oliver Twist with a humorous twist only he can provide. The make-up people did an incredible job with his facial mask without inhibiting Carrey's multitude of expressions, they poured through his eyes, nose and mouth without inhibition. In the end? I think it's a great flick for 9 years and up, mostly we parents get a kick out of the humor intended for us.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1170693/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw1170693,5," Diverting festive fare.
","In the UK, perhaps the most well-known Dr. Seuss book is ""The Cat In The Hat"" (filmed in 2003 with Mike Myers), but in America the best-loved and most widely read Dr. Seuss story would probably be ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"". Here, director Ron Howard takes the classic story and, with the help of an energetic Jim Carrey performance, transforms it into a diverting film experience. However, considering Howard's track record as a maker of excellent and moving films (e.g Apollo 13, Cocoon, EdTv, etc.) this is rather lightweight stuff. While it is fun to watch, and energetic, and diverting as mentioned, it is not a film that lingers in one's mind long after watching it. Rather like Christmas wrapping paper, it looks pretty and you have a fun time tearing into it, but ultimately it's something to be disposed of without much afterthought.In the town of Whoville, the Whos (residents) are preparing for Christmas. It is a time of year they love, going to extreme lengths to buy mountains of presents and trim their houses. One little girl who questions if all the hullabaloo surrounding Christmas might be a bit superfluous is Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the local postal worker Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin). Cindy Lou figures that Christmas shouldn't be about who buys the most gifts or who trims their house most spectacularly.... somewhere deep down inside she senses that Christmas should be about love, family and community. Overlooking Whoville is a large mountain which is home to a grumpy, hate-filled green creature called the Grinch (Jim Carrey). The Grinch famously hates everyone, but more than that he hates Christmas (since it was a Christmas-event-gone-wrong which drove him to turn his back on Who-kind). Condy Lou decides that the time has come to give the Grinch a chance to make amends with the Whos - and vice versa - but her friendly gesture backfires and the enraged Grinch plots to ruin the festivities by stealing everyones' presents.Carrey's performance as the Grinch is amazing, both for his manic physical energy and for the skill with which he conveys numerous emotions from beneath so many layers of make-up. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins uses his lovely Weslh lilt to provide the film with a classy narration. While the remaining performances are competent enough, none of them really stand out in a spectacular way. The set design by Meredith Boswell is also noteworthy, bringing the town of Whoville vibrantly to life. There seem to me to be two principal flaws with the film. First is the fact that the story is incredibly thin, with little to sustain a running time just short of two hours. Second (and most damaging) flaw is the heavy-handed, sickly-sweet preachiness. It's a sad thing if people have really become so self-centered that they've forgotten the honourable values associated with Christmas. But this film lays on the sentiment too thickly to convert those people into a better way of thinking. People who DO hold traditional values don't need a message like this ramming down their throat; and people who DON'T hold traditional values won't buy into this kind of sugary preaching.","

","DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) ***1/2 Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Taylor Momsen, Clint Howard, Anthony Hopkins (narrator)  (Dir: Ron Howard)Say what you will about Jim Carrey, but the man may be giving James Brown as The Hardest Working Man in Show Business in the latest of his tailor-made impersonations in his ongoing building to his big screen legacy as the titular, beloved grump that has entertained children of all ages for .well, all ages. Carrey, buried under all that wonderfully captured pear-shaped, mint colored fuzzy costume and scary affective make-up by wizard Rick Baker, gives all the gusto he can muster in making himself recognizable and making the iconic character a calling to his own brand of off-the-wall humor, riffing here and there, as Whoville's resident Sasquatch of sort. As the perennial Christmas season is in full bloom in the hamlet of Whos, all bustling in their eye-candy spectacular habitat of swirling, gravity defying environs and pastel colored schematics, it is tiny Cindy Lou Who (the adorable Momsen, fitted with chipmunk buck teeth) that questions why the nasty, ill-tempered outcast became the monster they all fear and have avoided dealing with for so many years.  After all, it seems to her that the holiday is apparently more than the giddy rush of giving multi-colored gift-wrapped presents and stringing thousands of blinking lights across rooftops to depict the true meaning of the season. The Grinch makes no bones about his loathing for the soppy, sentimental denizens below from his garbage heaped mountain topped domain that he shares only with his skeptical, long-suffering mutt, Max.  But even he begins to doubt his own behavior after several encounters with the well-meaning tiny Who, Cindy, who doesn't take him seriously at all. The script, adapted by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, nips and tucks the epic poem by the late great Seuss but allows its star to improvise and give a whirling dervish performance with much energy to spare not seen since his other green-faced incarnation of the party happy hero in `The Mask'.  His voice is perhaps his best instrument inhabiting the original narrator Boris Karloff who served double duty in turn as the Grinch's speaking inflections as well as a pinch of Richard Nixon, Edward G. Robinson and dare I say Jimmy Stewart with a toothache.  His eyes, hidden under reportedly painful yellow contact lenses, also get a full work out in his gleefully malevolent/benevolent turn here letting the audience in on what a ball he is having even if he is suffering for his art. Chuck Jones, who animated the television classic, was smart enough to have the ugly humbug sublime with the accent of a raised eyebrow and half-lidded indifference sustainingself-loathing rage that Carrey takes to the next level.  The subplot flashback depicting The Grinch as a child ostracized by the nasty Whos in school is heart-breakingly familiar to anyone who ever endured ridicule for being `different' and seems a bit heavy-handed but the point is clearly ironed out to full effect in getting why The Grinch stole Christmas. Kudos to director Howard, who at first seems out of his element, but you'd have to go way back to `Willow' to recollect his keen observation that production design is a must in telling the tale equally as well as the tale worth being filmed.  He has that in spades with a wonderfully true-to-form lifting from the book and the tv special with his team of Michael Croenblith's set designs, cinematographer Don Peterman's dark yet cheery on the edges photography and again Baker's memorable make-up (even if the Who's pig-snouted faces are a bit unsettling at first). The film also works to its seemingly adult overview with Carrey's side-of-the mouth WC Fields delivery of one-liners, double entendres and his slapstick hootenanny antics on full display here.  You'd have to be a Scrooge not to enjoy this sugary candy cane of a movie.","

","Not quite as timeless as the book or the original animated version, this movie is still pretty good. Ron Howard ably directs, and the incomparable Jim Carrey is the perfect Grinch. Look for the scene where Jim spoofs Ron; it's hilarious. Buy it on DVD, or at least rent it, because it has loads of Special Features and is a fun movie for all ages.","

","The only thing I knew about the film was that Jim Carrey is in it. I'm a great fan of him; his facial expressions are very good. And what did they do to him in this film, they covered up his face, they wasted the best bit.There were a few jokes in the film, but don't expect too much; it's really a film for young children. Don't watch it as a Jim Carrey fan because you will be disappointed.5/10","

","I just came back from seeing Mike Myers in Cat in the Hat.  Terrible piece of work, no further comment is necessary.  But our local newspaper's film critic seemed to like it and compared it favorably to Jim Carrey's Grinch, more or less saying that Grinch was a terrible adaption of Seuss.Well, I remembered Grinch a little more positively, perhaps because I found Carrey's performance particularly outstanding.  By and large, you have to pay me to watch Carrey, he's just not my cup of tea.  But in Grinch he was perfectly cast to be the stinky old curmudgeon Seuss intended.
I dug out of the closet my kids' copy of the movie, watched it again, watched my kids' faces while they watched along and came to this conclusion: The movie captures the spirit and texture of the good Doctor.  Carrey and the cast of Whoville take the audience on a fantastic journey through the Christmas experience and succeed in delivering Seuss's message,  God bless us, everyone.  Merry Christmas!!","

","Don't compare this to the original cartoon.  Nothing can compare to the cartoon.  If you come into the movie expecting the cartoon, you'll be p****d off at every minute that passes in this movie.  If, on the other hand, you just come in expecting a holiday movie, it is actually quite good.  Not the best, but still good for the whole family. Everyone knows the story about the Grinch, unless you've been stuck under a rock for the past fourty or so years.  The original story was about the Grinch, a green, furry guy who lives on a mountain above the town of Whoville.  Every Christmas, the Whovillians throw massive Christmas parties and celebrations, much to the dislike of the Grinch, who hates Christmas. He tries to steal Christmas by taking away every decoration, present, etc. He learns the true meaning of Christmas as the end, and a few other things happen, but that's it.  It's a short story overall. Then they try to make a movie out of it.  In order to make it run at least 90 minutes, Ron Howard had to add a lot of plot and such.  The Grinch is also given the typical Howard-treatment; he hates Christmas because of a traumatic experience during a Christmas party as a kid.  This completely contradicts the original story, which has him hating Christmas because he doesn't understand the meaning and thinks it's nothing more than a bunch of noise.  Jim Carrey, however, does a pretty good job as the Grinch; there were a few faults, but we don't know much about the Grinch anyway, so it deoesn't matter as much.  Rather, all the problems fall on Ron Howard's shoulders. What seperates this from other holiday movies of its ilk, however, is that effort actually went into it.  It seemed like everyone really wanted to make a good movie, and even though it doesn't match the cartoon, it's still an enjoyable experience.  So please, don't just compare it to the cartoon; just judge it as a movie itself.","

","It's amazing all that goes on, inside a normal snowflake!

It's a story that has been around for a long time, everyone knows it. The critic Ebert describes the movie fairly accurately, but gives it a lower rating than I do. Aside from Carrey, I especially enjoyed Bill Irwin, a virtually unknown and underrated actor who has great body movements and facial expressions. The DVD is of course sharp and colorful with great 5.1 sound. It also has a number of very nice extras for those of us who like to go behind the scenes to see how a film was made. One of the better ones that I have come across.","

","The Grinch is a good movie.  Having said that, I'll now tell you why.Jim Carrey has done some bad films. This isn't one of them. He's played some bad parts. This isn't one of them. He's played some great parts in great films. This is DEFINITELY one of them. Carrey plays the Mean One to perfection! Of course, that really expensive, really realistic costume didn't hurt, either.Taylor Momsen is (or at least was as of The Grinch) a newcomer from the great city of St. Louis. She performs superbly in quite a large role for a 7-year-old first-timer. The only way Cindy Lou Who could've been better is if she was animated.Anthony Hopkins is no Boris Karloff, but he still gets the job done wonderfully. Hopkins has incredible range, as demonstrated by his ability to sweetly narrate a Christmas movie and viciously portray a canniballistic genius murderer.Ron Howard did a great job with this thing. Obviously, the original story wasn't long enough to make a feature-length movie, but the extended version by Price & Seamen, along with Howard's directing, is almost as good as the cartoon version, and nearly as good as Suess's book.Great holiday movie. That's basically all there is to it.Whether or not you liked it, feel free to review it.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594460/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594460,4," How the Grinch stole what could have been a good film
","Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas is based on the childrens book by Dr. Seuss. In this live action film, Jim Carrey brings to life one of the most beloved stories of our time to the big screen with the direction of Ron Howard. The plot is taken straight from the book with a few creative liberties along the way. Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Who's, A munchkin like species that all love and adore Christmas. Yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty, green creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally loathes. Yet a small child named Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch and teach him what Christmas is really about.  What is probably the most interesting aspect of The Grinch is the cinematography of Whosville that Ron Howard brought to life. It would be very hard to live up to Dr. Seuss' standards in the book, but Whosville itself in this film is basically the only delight you have while watching. Jim Carrey does fit into the Grinch well, but too often we get an Ace Ventura vibe. Now I ask myself even in dramas why Jim Carrey always seems funny, even when he's acting serious, why is this? In the Grinch at times he seems calmed down to a certain degree, but the longer the camera rolls the more he starts to act up and eventually we can just picture Ace walking in that snow instead of the Grinch. One other thing I disliked is that in the cartoon the Grinch never talked much, but in this version all the Grinch does is talk. Of course both these films were taken off the book, but I still think Jim should have shut up half the time instead of rambling and doing wacky and crazy movements (like Ace.) The humor itself consists of only a few funny lines. In one scene the Grinch is sitting looking through his 'schedule' and is saying something like '1:30 Loathe-2:30 Have lunch with myself..I CAN'T cancel that again! 3:30 Feel sorry for myself..' And the scene basically goes on like that. I think that is probably the funniest scene in the film, and if you don't find that funny, you will hate the Grinch. I first saw this film in the theaters and expected too much. Perhaps that is why when I viewed the video release I enjoyed it more. If for some reason you do want to see this film, just don't expect it to be great and you might enjoy it more.  I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're an absolute fan of Dr. Seuss and in your opinion 'must see it.' Other than that, avoid the Grinch's good looks and charm, because there is not much of it in the film. 2/5 starsJOHN ULMER","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594457/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594457,NA," It's not really all that bad
","So much invective, so many hurt feelings on this one. Bad press and word of mouth followed this movie around like the plague upon its release at Thanksgiving, 2000. On one level, of course, I can understand it; ""Grinch"" certainly didn't need the big-screen, live action treatment - the simple half-hour cartoon is, and always will be, a classic unto itself. But exactly because that version is in no danger of going away or being forgotten (or - perish the thought! - replaced), I for one was able to be more generous and forgiving when watching this movie. Oh hell, I might as well admit it - I watched it at all pretty much explicitly to see what Jim Carrey was going to do with the lead role. On that score, I was not disappointed; he took the basic character sketch that is the Grinch and embroidered it with all manner of tics, impersonations, and over-the-top shenanigans. As usual, if you're no fan of Carrey - and broad humor in general - there's nothing here that will convert you. Me, I'm constantly astonished by his resourcefulness and creativity, as well as the almost superhuman energy he brings to every role. Here it's especially impressive, as he coaxes a pulsing life force to come through layers and layers of prosthetics. In fact, it occurred to me, watching the film, that if anyone could be a modern day Lon Chaney, it would be Jim Carrey - I could see him making a good career out of bringing life to a rogues' gallery of monsters, grotesques, and other costumed or heavily made-up characters. It would in fact seem the natural extension of his talents and inclination; if there's ever been anyone constrained by the notion of being a ""normal"" person, it's Jim Carrey. But by the same token, no one - not Jack Nicholson in Batman, not Christopher Lloyd in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, not even Paul Reubens as Pee Wee Herman - has seemed so at home projecting the weightlessness and exaggeration of a cartoon existence more fully than Jim Carrey. This is no easy trick by any stretch of the imagination, and I hope for all our sakes that he'll always at least keep his hand in this style of performing; there's many who can do ""realistic"" acting (in varying degrees of quality, of course) - there's precious few, maybe no one else currently alive, who can do what Carrey does.As to the movie itself: is there anything here beyond Carrey's performance that makes it worth seeing? Not really. But then again there's nothing that really gets in the way, either. The sets and the basic look of the movie are reasonably well done: nothing overtly memorable, but not the ugly and barren wasteland many reviewers have suggested. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou-Hoo is suitably cute in her part without being insufferable (and on that score let's not forget that even Dr. Seuss's Cindy Lou was impossibly precious and saccharine in the first place) and she develops a nice rapport with Carrey that helps anchor the film. The backstory which ""explains"" the Grinch and how he became that way . . . well, yeah, it's stupid, but it also doesn't take up much time, so if you just twiddle your thumbs for a few minutes you can get through it without too much pain or discomfort. But many objected to the film on the basic grounds that its portrayal of the Hoos was an abomination; that it took the simple, good-hearted creatures of the Dr. Seuss original and turned them into lunk-headed and materialistic busybodies - in essence, caricatures of Yuletide soul-lessness and consumerism. Personally, I think it's an interesting change. Seuss's heart was always more with Grinch's cynicism and disgruntlement anyway, so it makes sense to pile on those qualities in an extended treatment of the story. Furthermore, while the Hoos as paragons of perfect virtue and simplicity works OK in a 22-minute treatment (especially one where we don't see much of them), there's something fundamentally false and unsatisfying about it. After all, even in the original tale, these people *are* pretty ostentatious and materialistic in their celebration of Christmas. It makes sense to me that they - just as much as the Grinch - would need a reminder in what the true meaning of the holiday season really is before they would lovingly burst into song at the prospect of a Christmas without any presents or decorations. And, of course, this makes them closer in conception to the average American, and thereby more identifiable and accessible (if necessarily less admirable). Especially since, as I've said, this new version doesn't wipe out the old one, I think the change in the Hoos is utterly defensible and adds an interesting wrinkle that the film can truly call its own. So that's the Grinch, circa 2000 - no big whoop, but no big travesty either. And if you like Jim Carrey, another notch on his belt of impressive performances. That's really all you need to know.","

","This extravagant work by Ron Howard et al can hardly be compared to the original 1966 Classic.  Kudos to the make-up crew who creatively disguised all actors, and to the set decorators and costume designers.  HOWEVER, I could not get past the mean spiritedness of the movie which was not found in the original Dr. Seuss book.  I somehow feel that Dr. Seuss may have been rolling in his grave.  The best character in the movie has to be the dog Max.  Wait for the video release.","

","It's tough to rate a movie that tells a story we all know by heart. Knowing the story takes away from the surprise factor. The question is no longer ""what will happen?"", it is ""how will it be depicted?""In this big screen version of the cartoon many of us grew up on, there is an effort to provide some back story as to why the Grinch is a Grinch. But the effort is feeble, and hardly explains why this creature would remove himself from contact with others (aside from his dog) for years. Get mad, yes. Ostracize himself from ""whoo-manity,"" no, at least not without assuming some serious mental problems.The 'Hoos (or Whose, whatever) are an odd bunch. Some are tiny, but most are the same size. They have odd little pig noses and big ears. But really, they seem like regular humans in make-up. Shallow, uninteresting humans, but still human. This takes away from the sense that what we are watching is a fantasy world different from our own lives. There is an opening scene that brings us to the Hoo world (and out again at the end), and for all its effort to symbolize a journey to a magical land, it really seems like so much fluff and a half-hearted attempt to get us to buy into what we are supposed to believe.Jim Carrey is, well, Jim Carrey. I have a hard time picturing anyone else who could have been the Grinch. Carrey adds some heart to an essentially heartless figure, and some of his trademarked manic humor. I wish he had been allowed to use *more* of that, to make the Grinch seem a little mentally unbalanced instead of simply lonely and grumpy.The rest of the cast is essentially lost, with the exception of the little girl who plays the Hoo who believes in the Grinch. Her parents, the neighbor (inexplicably dressed in a cleavage bearing outfit, though she seems as asexual as could be), the mayor, and everyone else is interchangeable and unmemorable.I fear this Grinch movie will be one of those ""holiday family films"" that will show up each year on the networks (a la Home Alone). It probably deserves that fate. It is just interesting enough for kids to watch and not nearly good enough to be a must-see film (such as The Wizard of Oz). There was something missing here, but I can't bring myself to care enough to figure out what it is. We gave this a 6, mostly for Jim Carrey.","

","Jim Carrey adds incredible humor to this, which could've been a dreary and stupid adaption of the classic cartoon and book, and is genuinely funny, which makes the film succeed on many levels. Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor are also very good, as well as the supporting cast. Some minor qualms include the child grinch, which is played stiffly at best, and some of the liberties it took from the book. It basically includes all the essential elements, however, and is a very entertaining and funny family film. A lot of stupid children's films try and desperately show that they can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids, to try and increase their ticket sales. Every children's film I see advertised has some moron saying that it will be enjoyed by adults. The only kids movie I've ever enjoyed before this was Antz, and this works for everyone, not just kids. Perhaps thats why it did so astoundingly at the box-office.","

","REVIEW OF THE GRINCH: **1/2First off, Tim Burton should have directed this and Christopher Walken should have been the Grinch. Don't get me wrong, Jim Carrey was great, but the movie was too lighthearted. There could have been a darker, more adult fantasy movie buried underneath all of the slapstick humor, which Chris and Tim wouldn've pulled off perfectly. But alas, no. This is no more than a dumb children's movie that is too scary for kids and too childish for adults. Next, there is NO way to make a 2 HOUR MOVIE of a 19 page book! It's like turning Weekend Update into a 4 hour epic. So, for about an hour and a half, nothing happens except for Jim Carrey re-enacting The Mask. Then, by the time ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" starts playing, you wish that you had just gone to see Rugrats or The 6th Day. The make-up is great though. But if I was Ron Howard, I would've convinced Tim Burton to do this movie and have Christopher Walken to be the Grinch. Then, it would've been more darker, more ironic, and less dumb and more time would be spent on why Grinch became such a Grinch. Sorry that I'm raining on everyone's parade, BUT IT'S JUST MY FREAKIN' OPINION!","

","I had my reservations about having Jim Carrey in the starring role, but with Ron Howard at the helm, this movie had to be a winner.  Boy were we wrong! This film was a total disappointment.  Jim Carrey was way over the top. It was more like Jim Carrey was being played by the Grinch, not the other way around.The costumes, make-up and scenery were beautiful. The soundtrack was very well done.  BUT WHO LET THE LITTLE GIRL SING?  It was horrible!  Her acting was very good though.  Why didn't they dub her voice? It ruined what would have been a great Christmas song.  I don't think anyone will remember it now.The simple tale has been completely bastardized.  The only part that kind of worked was the background as to how the young Grinch became the Grinch. As they needed to make a 20 minute cartoon fill an hour and a half they should have worked this angle more.The moral of this review, is to keep this picture from your view. It could have been better, even merry, but that would require a lot less Carrey. You should not have put up, nor been a coward. How could you do this Mr. Howard?","

","I just saw ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" last night at a local Washington DC premier party. Overall... an great movie that will stand the test of time, much like the original cartoon special itself. Jim Carrey BECAME the Grinch, much like he throws himself into all of his roles (see ""Man In The Moon""). Lots of ad-lib-style comments from Carrey as the Grinch provided chuckles. The first half of the movie explains how and why the Grinch became bitter toward the holiday season, and establishes the mayor of WhoVille as a villain in his own right. The second half of the film catches up to the familiar gift and tree stealing plotline from the original series, and fleshes it out with more scenes. The sets are incredible to watch, and don't be surprised if there may be times when you don't catch some dialogue because of the scenery.
Taylor Momsen is delightful as Little Cindy Lou Who, the child who's persistence in discovering the good inside the Grinch, ends up saving WhoVille's Christmas. Jeffrey Tambor plays the thoughtless and subtly cruel Mayor of WhoVille to a ""T"", and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.
Ron Howard also pokes fun at himself in several scenes, stealing notable images from movies such as Backdraft, and even having the Grinch direct his dog Max in a scene, wearing the same style hat that Howard wears when directing his films!I was surprised at the inclusion of two PG-13 style visual jokes (involving a female character's breasts, and a dog's rear-end), and for the parents of young children, these may be embarrassing moments that you may dread having to explain to the youngsters.But overall, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is an excellent movie that reminds young and old of the true meaning of Christmas in a pleasant and charming way.","

The VISUALS were beautiful and fabulous. The attention to detail was terrific and I will need to see it again to catch everything. I'm not one to fawn over Jim Carrey just because that's what everyone else does, but I have to say that he was absolutely incredible in this role. His body language is hilarious and he was a delight to watch. The little girl Who, Cindy Lou-Who is sweet and adorable. When she giggles while sliding down the shute I couldn't help but laugh along with her. I really enjoyed the way they put in the background story about the Grinch as a baby.

","Ron Howard's version of ""The Grinch"" is a bloated, over the top Hollywood induldgence and would be utterly forgettable if it weren't for Jim Carrey's amazing performance.  Apart from Carrey's screen time as the fascinating Grinch, this movie is more or less typical commerical fare, not particurarly original and quite noisy.  However, when Carrey appears, the film changes into something completely different; wild, unpredictable and impossible to ignore.  In the DVD collector's edition Carrey explains that he's was basically ""buried alive"" on a daily basis in the Grinch make up and costume. The results show in his acting, which is manic, possessed and in the end, quite ingenius.  I'm not sure what the Academy looks for anymore as far as award winning, but Carrey's turn at the Grinch certaintly deserved at least a best actor nomination.  My favorite Grinch moments are when Carrey interacts with Cindy Lou, the obligatory ""big budget family film 'cute as a button' child actor.""  WARNING:  SPOILERS AHEAD;  My favorite dialogue is when Carrey says, ""Saving you?  Is that what you think I was doing? Wrong-o.""  And when he finally agrees to become Holiday Cheermister he tells Cindy, ""I don't know if its that adorable little twinkle in your eye or that non-conformist streak that reminds of a younger, less hairy me but you've convinced me.""  Carrey's pulls off some other wonderful zingers throughout the film; with the mistle toe, ""Now, pucker up and kiss it Whoville."" When he's terrozing the town, ""Oh the who-manity!""  And also when he rides his sleigh down at a crazy speed, ""We're gonna die!  I'm gonna throw up and then I'm gonna die.""  But the classic segment (also featured on the CD), is Carrey reciting the Grinch's schedule, ""4:00 wallow in self pity, 4:30: stare into the abyss, 6:30 dinner with me.  I can't cancel that again.""  As far as the non-Grinch scenes, they are well acted but under written.  And the actress playing Cindy Lou is sugary sweet and highly annoying.  The part where she sings is almost unbearable.  In the end though, ""The Grinch"" succeeds because Jim Carrey loses himself in the role.  The original Seuss grinch in the 1960's cartoon was a riot, the ultimate villain you love to hate.  Carrey shows that even as we enter the new milennium, Dr. Seuss created one of the coolest, most unforgettable rebels in history.","

The little girl was very cute the moral to the story is one that everyone should remember during Christmas time.  Just remember that this movie was intended to be families and it fulfilled our expectations.  We will be watching this movie for every Christmas as long as the kids are home.","

The vision of Whoville is amazing, a big WoW to Mr. Howard and friend's for that creation.    I really liked the way that they gave the history of The Grinch as well.Even though this movie was made for kids, i still loved it.  And although there is so much that is good about it, the only thing i didnt like was the way that they made the grinch an all-the-time snotty bully.  The whole scene of the Town Party could have been more child-friendly also.  But overall it was excellent.  I'd give it a 9/10.","

",First of all I would like to say that this really isn't that bad a film. You've got to respect the makers for the amount of effort which has obviously gone into it even if the final product wasn't so good. Having not seen the original animated version I believe that I am able to give an un-biased opinion of this. Personally I think that Jim Carrey is back on top form with his highly amusing and eccentric portrayal of the Grinch. Admittedly some of the gags do the miss the mark but many hit the target full on and I found many suprisingly adult considering that this is a children's film. At this point in time I would like to congratulate the make-up department for their flawless effects and daring to make the big star of the film completely unrecognisable. 7/10,"

","As I feared, the story didn´t hold. It might work as a 20 minute long cartoon, but not as a full-length motion picture. The plot is simply to thin and drawn-out. It circulates around the Grinch, a green monster who´s terrorising the peculiar citizens of Whoville. He simply doesn´t enjoy Christmas, but a sweet little girl tries to change his mind.Positive things about the movie are the set-pieces, costumes and the effects, they are well-made. And Jim Carrey, of course. He is perfect as the Grinch, even if his performance reminds a little too much of his role in ""The Mask"" at times. But the funniest scenes are definitely the ones with Carrey and his charmy dog. The rest of the characters are extremely irritating and thin, with the possible exception of Taylor Momsen´s Cindy Loo Who. If I got to decide how the movie ended, the citizens of Whoville wouldn´t get any presents at all. But it´s not my call, and here we are with a hopeless movie that claims to be about the true meaning of Christmas. Which is, apparently, the presents.2/5","

","First off I am going to admit that I love the animated classic, so that is more than likely going to have some bearing on this review. In the animated one the Grinch is mean & nasty. He hates Christmas & that is all I need to know. Ron Howard (whose films I usually like) has made this Grinch merely a vehicle for Jim Carrey to go over the top and get quite annoying. Jim Carrey in my opinion is at his best when he shows some restraint. ""The Truman Show"" is my favourite role for him. Albeit I don't think anyone else could have pulled off the Grinch quite as well as he tried to. There are a few funny lines, but sadly not much else to this slow and quite frankly bad film. Perhaps they could have dragged out the story to fill an hour. Which in children's films is still somewhat respectable, but this thing goes on far too long. This first hour of this film has absolutely NOTHING to do with the animated classic. It is only after an hour of Carrey mugging and doing some rather stupid tricks for the camera do we get to the meat of the story...The Grinch STEALING Christmas. Those scenes in the classic were great (as is the whole thing),but yet again we have Carrey's Grinch being LOUD and obnoxious while he is breaking into the Whos homes & stealing all their stuff. He even uses a vacuum for crying out loud. Now that is a quiet way of robbing somebody isn't it. The animated Grinch is a much better thief I guess. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* The line ""maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store"" dare I say it the moral of the tale is ruined by one of the opening shots of every Who down in Whoville going nuts and spending every who-dollar and every who-minute shopping for Christmas presents. In fact the only Who down in Whoville that knows any better is Cindy Lou who is a quite bit older than 2 in this film. Do yourself a favour and either watch The CLASSIC animated version when it is on TV or rent it.Do NOT. Repeat DO NOT get sucked into the marketting hype that is the live action GRINCH because it just plainly WHO-SUCKS!","

The adorable Taylor Momsen is perfect as Cindy Lou Who: She's very cute, but not to the point where it gets on the audience's nerves. The rest of the stellar cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, and Clint Howard) is absolutely awesome! James Horner's musical score is so warm and heartfelt, and it really adds a lot to the movie.

","First let me say that I love Ron Howard. I also appreciate Jim Carrey. I've seen the half hour animation every Christmas my whole childhood. The way this movie was blown into a feature length film was fine. Most of the added stuff fit with the characters and story established in the original. But it was a little too loud. Sometimes, way too loud. The sets were incredible and the make-up was great, but it's much easier to sit through a half hour than two hours plus. Still, you can do worse for a holiday movie.

","$123 Million dollars to do a remake of a 22 minute cartoon!  Ridiculous!!! 
Ron Howard is fine as director, and Carrey is almost tame as the grinch, but pulls it off.  But the actually movie is slow-paced, dull, loud, too big and gets lost in itself.  I think the intentions were very good, but got swallowed by the Hollywood Machine!This movie should have been about 20 or more minutes shorter than it was. Alot of unnecessary scenes, and build up just started to bore me.  We did not need to see the Grinch as a child.  That was never an issue in the cartoon...He was just the Grinch...Plain and Simple!Not enough time was spent on the parts that were from the cartoon.  The Cheeriest Person Award, or whatever it was called, was just silly and padding as far as I'm concerned.  There was just too much in the movie to really appreciate the Dr. Seuss of it all.  The costumes, makeup, sets, etc. were brilliant and breath-taking.  They really did give it the cartoon feel, but went way over the top.Overall it they cut it down, took out the Love interest of the Grinch ( what was up with that???), and just stuck to the main points.  A 45 min or hour long Live version would have been more than sufficent.4 out of 10 for the film 10 out of 10 for the costumes, set, and makeup!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594323/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594323,NA," ghastly remake of a classic
","Why is it that Hollywood moviemakers seem incapable of understanding the simple fact that works that start off as drawing art (be they in the form of stills or animated cartoons) have a tough time translating to the live action format?  It didn't work with `The Flintstones,' for instance, and it works even less well with `How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' Ron Howard's labored and lumbering attempt to bring the whimsical Dr. Seuss classic to the big screen.  Unlike the beloved half hour animated version made for television in the 1960's, this non-animated edition ends up burying the wise and witty tale under gobs of overproduction.  Despite the best efforts of the costume designers, set decorators and makeup artists in bringing the Grinch, the Whos and their village of Whoville to life on the screen, the sad fact is that what appears charming on the two-dimensional printed page can often become grotesque when transferred to the more three-dimensional world of live action filmmaking. Even more detrimental than the film's garish visual style is the fact that the beautiful simplicity of the streamlined tale has been padded out and stretched to the breaking point to fulfill the demands of a 105-minute running time.  Although the film adheres fairly closely to the original plotting in its final third (even using a portentous recitation by Anthony Hopkins of Dr. Seuss' original rhyming text), the first hour or so is overloaded with dreary subplots involving the various Who characters, a silly flashback showing how the Grinch came to hate Christmas, and enough Jim Carrey shtick to make us wish he had never left `In Living Color' to embark on a movie career.  Much as I have loved Carrey in some of his earlier filmic efforts, I must say that his act is fast losing much of its original freshness and charm.  Not that he can be forced to shoulder all the responsibility for the film's failure, since the writers, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, have neglected to provide a single line of witty or creative dialogue to go along with the stunning makeup, art direction and special effects.  It's a particular embarrassment when the screenplay shifts between the soaring ingenuity of the Seuss poetry and the flatfooted triteness of the Price/Seaman prose.  The grinding of the gears becomes almost audible.  One wonders why an industry, which used to do so well by Christmas in the past (`It's a Wonderful Life,' `Miracle on 34th Street,' the various versions of `A Christmas Carol'), seems to have had so much trouble lately putting together a decent picture with a yuletide theme.  In fact, in the past 20 or so years, Hollywood has managed to produce only one holiday film that can truly be called a certified classic.  I am speaking, of course, of the wonderful 1983 film, `A Christmas Story,' the only work that has been able to successfully combine the gentle cynicism of the modern world with the sweet sentimentality one traditionally associates with the holiday. Perhaps that perennial delight will forever stand as the one exception to the cold crassness of overproduced and over-budgeted dreck like `Jingle All the Way,' `Santa Claus  the Movie' and `How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' which, by their very nature, drain Christmas of its childlike magic and charm.  Now more than ever, `A Christmas Story' is the yuletide tonic we yearn for and need.","

","I'd never heard of this story before (probably because I'm from Europe), but I must say that I was immediately dragged into it. The film (I do not know about the book) really captures today's dealing with Christmas as being about gifts and presents, whereas it clearly should not be. At least the film does so during the first 30 minutes and the last 20 minutes or something. The rest of the time is filled up by Jim Carrey's usual goofing around (in a Riddler manner) and I felt that was pretty much of a shame, because the film could have been so much better if it had stayed focused on the main theme and would not have focused on Carrey's grimaces and stunts. It is just that Jim Carrey can overdo it sometimes and most directors just let him (why oh why???). I mean let him bring some character into that Grinch, I know he can do that.Anyway, besides the costumes designers, set designers and makeup people on this film there was also one person on screen that really impressed me. It was little Cindy Lou  Who (Taylor Momsen). I mean she was just so sweet and charming it was really mostly her acting that will get you into the TRUE Christmas spirit. And remember: If anyone tries to ruin Christmas,don' t give in an inch Cause everyone likes Christmas, even the Grinch

I mean, Al Gore doesn't push the Christmas stuff that he stole from Whyville over the mountain! Don't tell me that it was in Dr. Suess' story; it still tells you that dreams are silly!Also, there is no point to remaking good films anyway. What do I mean, you ask? Psycho, Planet of the Apes, and now this piece of ****. And to think, we pay money to see CGI-and-nothing-else films like this!Rating: -86566/6PS: Notice that I never said one specific word from the title? PSS: In the rating, look at the last three numbers. That describes it!","

","As a child I never understood why the name Grinch, and I'm equally stumped as to why the name Scrooge, has always been used to describe someone not in the Christmas spirit. It seems to me that if you call someone 'Grinch' it should be a compliment, not a detriment. When I grew up, and perhaps you can translate that into when I lost innocence, I realized the irony of the definition of the name Grinch. This character is supposed to be the isolated and lonely. It's supposed to be all of us from time to time. But the reality is that he does not represent the few, he represents us all. Why do we continue to use the name Grinch to describe someone not in the Christmas spirit when the lesson of the story is that the Grinch kept Christmas in his heart? The same goes for Scrooge who kept Christmas with him for the rest of his life. The reason is that because these two characters represent us all. Aren't we all these characters for eleven months of the year and only when we hit December do most of us dust off our liberality's in the name of righteousness? We forget that the Grinch became a being that loved Christmas, but only for the last few minutes of the story, or in our lives, December.So for me this film does not work. It is not set to the same time as is the Dr. Suess classic. It tries to give the Grinch a reason for his isolation and his loneliness and that doesn't need to be done. The point of Suess's story was that the Grinch was upset. He was angry and he was lonely and in the end he was redeemed. Period. This film tries to show us that he is worth redeeming because some children made fun of him. Isn't Christmas a time when anyone can be redeemed? Why tell me why someone is worthy of redemption. If the Grinch wasn't picked on as a child should he have been shunned by the Who's? If the spirit of Christmas, and indeed the Dr. Suess book, is so magical, why give me a back story? Even though Dickens does give us a back drop for Scrooge to hang his isolation on, we know from the beginning that everyone, regardless of Scrooge's story, wants Ebenezer to be part of their Christmas. Here we are given a reason why we should include the Grinch, and that goes against the point of the season. It once seemed to me that we needed to hold on to the magic of Christmas the whole year through. Now I would be excited if we could hold on to it if only for one night in December.","

You can put special effects in a film all you can and want, the film isn't neccesarily the greatest. The Godfather was a portrait of real life, and was great. This is fiction (and shows), and is bad. And my heart is normal sized. (If you're reading this on Christmas, watch the original-it has quality.)","

","Delightfully faithful adaptation of Dr. Seuss' children's classic story about a Tim Burton-esque outsider who decides to steal Christmas from the unsuspecting peaceful residents of Whoville when they treat him with fear and dread. Jim Carrey is perfectly suited to the lead role of the odious Grinch, while newcomer Taylor Momsen makes the most adorable Cindy Lou Who, the faithful little girl who decides that Christmas is for everyone, even the mean old man who hates everybody. It is to director Ron Howard's credit that neither the performances of the stars nor the fable-like production design overpower the simple magic of Dr. Seuss' story. Every time the story has the opportunity to be overripe and saccharine, Howard restrains himself and lets the charming (but somewhat hypocritical) message speak for itself: Christmas is more than just presents and commercial hype (please pick up your Grinch action figures and colouring books at the door). The production was also helped along by the supervision of Seuss' widow who had approval over the film's screenplay (and did make some major cuts during pre-production). Costumes are a complete delight, and the makeup design by Rick Baker is pure genius. Film's only weak point is the uncommitted narration by Anthony Hopkins, who tries but never EVER comes close to the hilarious menace of Boris Karloff's voice work in the original cartoon. A family-film must!","

","This is a big part of my childhood here--my all-time favorite children's book (narrowly beating out (""The Monster at the End of this Book"").  My parents tell me that repeated bedtime readings caused me to have this book memorized by the time I was four.  Suffice to say, I was apprehensive when I first heard about this project.  But, I told myself to keep an open mind. After all, this movie could never compare to the understated genius of the Dr. Seuss book or the Chuck Jones cartoon--those works were untouchable. Therefore, to be fair to the filmmakers involved, this latest adaptation needed to be judged on its own merit.Of course, that would be much easier to do if the movie didn't steal so much from the cartoon.  Using the musical numbers ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" and ""Welcome Christmas"", and even ripping off a couple of the sight gags, it's more appropriate to say that this is an adaptation of the cartoon than it is the book.  That really bothered me, especially after I made a conscious effort to leave my adult cynicism at the door, putting myself in a child's mindset, and hoping to enjoy the movie as such.  The movie incorporates a number of post-modern ""in-jokes"" that make fun of pop-culture and current events.  An effort to entertain the parental units in the theatre, these jokes ripped me back into adult cynicism and forced me to think about the desensitizing effect of violence in the media and how ridiculous it is when a movie star runs in slow motion to escape an exploding fireball.  Well, fine.  So be it.  If the filmmakers wanted to appeal to adults, than as an adult, I say this is an overblown spectacle whose message is undercut by the shameless merchandising and licensing that accompanies this film.  Save yourself eight bucks and go read the book with a child.  You'll probably get a lot more fulfillment out of that, anyway.Grade:  C-","

","I can tell you the exact moment when this film turns from being a great, dark-humored comedy into a typical American capitalistic piece of cow dung. It's when the Grinch gives in to being shoved around at the big party scene. Up until this point we are given some of the best anti-capitalistic monologue ever spoken on this (American) side of the Atlantic Ocean. The reason is that this character, the Grinch, is a perfect Mr. Cranky, or Scrooge, of the modern age. He is brilliant, and if nothing else this reveals just how brilliant can be some of the stock writers working in Hollywood when given the opportunity to vent their complaints against the conformed state of society, particularly Christianity, and our corrupt economic system, of which Christmas is the not-so-sacred icon.Had the Grinch kept it up, had he held on to his real life, dirtied and lie exposing beliefs until the end, the story would have been -- well, honest. One may have been able to place it in a favorable light next to such uniquely honest films as, say The Last Exit to Brooklyn, The Electric Horseman and The Magic Christian. But Howard of course is no where near these other, more earnest fellows. He's just another typical Hollywood cop-out, a conservative American who really believes that the 50s were ""happy days"" and the world would be a better place if we all just forget, for example, that a Panama invasion ever happened and instead concentrate on ways to make our nation a safe place to live for wealthy and middle-class white Christians. He's a lot like our new Republican president.And so, the cranky, brilliant Mr. Grinch is a villain, to be eradicated in the name of white consumer-capitalists with upturned noses. It is so disappointing to see him go, to watch as he gives in to being the phony-happy faced Master of Ceremonies. His unique, individualistic opinions could have been given more light instead. This would've been great wine for the Who's of Who-ville, and the rest of us Americans as well.","

","This is an ugly movie that exploits just about everything associated with Christmas. Plus, it's disjointed, even for a bad film...kind of like the family heirloom Aunt Bertha pasted from old jigsaw puzzles while waiting for the Grim Reaper. Everywhere are stuck bits and pieces of assorted plots with no relevance to each other or to a larger whole. There's something to offend everyone in ""Grinch"", but then, it IS a Jim Carrey movie, so that's part of the point. I wandered how he would fit his trademark anal humor into a Dr. Suess classic, and sure enough, he found a way! That, combined with a Who wife-swapping party and a gremlin grinch child film extender, nominates this turkey as the all time worst holiday movie.The saving grace of ""Grinch"" is that wonderful Song to Warm Your Heart, warbled by Cindy Lou Who. This little ditty was so shockingly bad, the audience reaction brought my dozing partner to snorting wakefulness. Imagine someone with Margaret O'Brian's acting talent singing manipulative lyrics to awful music while gazing at the moon through an upturned rat's nose. Not since the polar bear wandered in the backdrop of the 1972 ""Lost Horizon"" has a film been so unintentionally hilarious. Forget forking over money for Ron Howard. Go for this moment alone.""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a film that brings the whole family together. Each person- mother, father, teen and tiny babe, are united in one thought...What Was That!? Toss this treasure in the free box at the next family garage sale.","

Ron Howard deserves a nomination at the least for Best Director. If this movie doesn't win Best Costumes, Best Special Effects, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Score, and Best Sound then they should shut down the Academy. NOTHING WILL TOP IT IN THOSE CATEGORIES.Of course, it's commercial success and the fact that the Academy seems to hate comedies and what it feels are crowd pleasing movies seems to point to them ignoring it completely.It is funny, it is uplifting, it is Dr. Seuss brought to life in the way we always wanted it to be.  It doesn't take itself too seriously and it has a smooth flowing pace.In short RUN to the theatres and maybe we can make this one beat Titanic.","

","How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing.  Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it.Screenwriters Jeffery Price & Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to full life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show.Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story.  Having read the original story, I must say I cannot agree.  The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story.  Indeed, it  enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was.*MILD SPOILERS*  (They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.)I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school.  I think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on.  I know I was... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through.And Cindy Lou Who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heart rending.  When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend.  If only everyone could have such an attitude.In fact, I think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content.  It was already pretty restrained, but any of this adult humor (like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.This one's well on its way to being a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.","

","Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest ""serious"" performances (""The Truman Show"", ""Man on the Moon""), I've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor: those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any ""institution"" that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as ""Titanic"" shouldn't be taken seriously.On with the review. ""The Grinch"" is the sweetest, best looking, best acted, more enjoyable seasons film since ""The Nightmare before Christmas"". Both movies seem very similar, too, with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their principal actors seem like the villains (one in a higher degree than the other), both pack a strong moral lesson, and both are truly enjoyable.That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.","

","How the Grinch Stole Christmas is worthwhile for its performances, namely by Jim Carrey as the Grinch.  I rated it a 6 out of 10.  I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss' books and the original Grinch cartoon from 1966, and I had high hopes for this remake.  However, I was somewhat disappointed with the movie.  In particular, I felt that it could have been crafted a little better to be a ""classic"".  After all, the story and characters are timeless.  But a classic movie this was not.  The pace of the movie seemed to drag a little bit, the town of Whoville (frankly) seemed a little boring and unappealing to me. There were also a few too many modern-day-Hollywood-like-add-ins in the movie which (in my opinion) dated it and detracted from its impact.  I was also disappointed with the art direction and set design.  The illustrations from the Dr. Seuss books and from the original cartoon are unmatched in their creativity.  The movie dabbled a little, remaining true to the general feel of these designs, but it broke no new creative ground with its art direction and set design.  Ron Howard has done some ""great"" directing in the past.  His direction here was simply ""good""--not his best work.  But the movie is at its best when we are allowed to watch Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He was wonderful.  His performance is perhaps even Oscar-nomination-worthy, depending on the competition.  He is funny, menacing, sad and joyful; and I felt his character truly grew and developed throughout the film.  Carrey makes the movie worthwhile.  Just don't expect magic.","

The little girl who played Wendy Lou Who was excellent but could not sing and I found that to be part of her charm. Ron Howard's brother Clint as usual has a part in this movie (Mayors right hand man). There were comparisons to Tim Burton's work and the look was like something out of one of his movies but I think it was different enough to be uniquely Ron Howard (At least he did not let Danny Elfman score it!).

","The kids should definitely enjoy this one, so being an adult I feel a bit of a killjoy criticizing it. It's definitely got style and Jim Carrey is excellent as the grouch. However, I think it falls short of being a classic, which it could have been.It's hard to put my finger on why not, but I felt it lacked a bit of magic. The formula was all there, but there was something it didn't quite capture. Maybe it was to do with the sets for whoville. There was something about them that seemed as though they were a more expensive department store christmas display than a film setting. It could be that the supporting cast wasn't overly impressive - though this could have been due to the script. Cindy-lou borders on being irritating particularly when she sings. It's hard to criticize a child actor, but I think they could have cast somebody a little less irksomely cute.
Perhaps it was the fact I wasn't convinced by the Grinch's conversion. Compare this to the way Scrooge is transformed in Sims' A Christmas carol - a far more dramtic portrayal. I just think the film could have been a bit braver as a whole, avoiding Hollywood conventions and making a bit less predictable. In addition, I didn't think it was particularly funny - maybe it wasn't supposed to be.All in all, despite the criticism, a competent children's tale, that less cynical beings should enjoy. But don't expect anything innovative. If I'm being honest, I think such a big budget spectacular would have been better in the hands of someone like Tim Burton or Spielberg.","

","This is a great movie, very, very well done and very funny. Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch, no one else could have pulled it off with as much humor as he did.  The rest of the cast was very good, and the characters were very well defined. (yep, even Max the Grinch's companion)  I liked the whole feeling of this fantasy, it looked very good and everything about it was done just like Dr. Seuss would have done it.-Great for the holidays-Happy Who-lidays (sorry i couldn't resist)","

","I just saw it, and to be honest I really enjoyed it. There were parts that you could call simple story padding-mostly the young grinch scenes, yet I felt for the most part it moved along well and was quite well handled.Some of these complaints here are goofy. 'Film to dark'! Rubbish. The town is one big neon Ornament; the Grinch's lair is exactly what you'd EXPECT it to look like, at least if you have a clue as to what he's about.The little girl, I thought, delivered an Excellant performance, and if you put her alongside Haley Osment, she'd be Fine. She helps carry this flick, if she tanked, it would tank whenever Carrey wasn't there.He is great, perfect guy for the role. I like him in this about as much as I did as the Riddler and the Mask, it's really the kind of thing he does the best.Loved the heart shown at the end, the terrific F/X esp. the panoramic view of their mountainous world. It truly brings you into the Suess World.By all means check this out-it's not Great but it is pretty good-and well worth yer time.*** outta ****.The dog is good too!","

","I really thought this was a great film.  I was expecting an average film based on the comments in IMDB but I was surprised by how good this film was.I think the purists are the people who criticize this movie. If you are expecting the movie to be exactly like the cartoon then maybe you won't like it.  Of course if they kept it excactly the same it would be a short 20 minute movie.I'm glad they didn't try to make the movie exactly like the cartoon.  I think some parts are better then the cartoon and this movie is certainly a lot more funny.  They have taken the story of the original cartoon and added a lot more to it.  If they had just done it like the original then there would not be much point in seeing the movie.  This movie has all the charm of the cartoon, plus you get to see what happened during the Grinch's childhood that turned him into the Grinch.This film also had more humor then the cartoon.  Some scenes were hilarious and some of the ab libs or creative ideas thrown in made the film very good. I'd give this movie a score of 9 out of 10 stars.If you like Jim Carrey, like special effects, or like to see creative films then see this movie.  I've seen most of the new movies this year and this movie is one of the best films that has come out this year.","

","Every year I look forward to the television classic, ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" so there was no way opening night of the silver screen version would go by without me in the audience. In a room packed with children and parents, my friends and I were the only all-adult group present -- and I think we laughed more than anyone. Jim Carey was absolutely outstanding in the title role, offering children and us children-at-heart new twists on the character that left me rolling in the aisle. Now I'll have two versions of this movie to look forward to every year!","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594191/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594191,6," A fun and psychological look at Dr. Seuss' infamous character
","Dr. Seuss' infamous character (as famous as any Seuss character besides Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham) no comes to the big screen. And I couldn't be happier. Especially because not only does the film team up to great film people- Actor Jim Carrey and producer/director Ron Howard, the makeup effects in this film is the best I've seen in years. It is simply amazing craftwork done on Jim Carrey as he is enveloped in the Grinch caharcter, and even though you can't see him exactly, his personality, voice and soul is shining through at all times. What also attracted me to the movie is that it takes a look at The Grinch in a way that you understand his phsyche. If you were to read the book or watch the 1966 TV cartoon (which was also fun), all you would see is the basics (and or the third act of this film). But in most of the film, we see how the grinch has been transformed into an antihero and how he may be mad outside, but inside, he has a heart (even if it's 2 sizes to small). But the seriousness beside, this film is pure fun. It's consistently funny as we look at Carrey use his grinch to make the audience yuckle up. And it works. A true family film (kids, adults and teens will range from being amused to being convulsed in laughter), this is the film of the season, that is unless Unbreakable passes it.","

https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0594183/?ref_=tt_urv,grinch,rw0594183,9," Fascinating fantasy
","""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a delightful fantasy-comedy from director Ron Howard. The film, based on the classic children's book by Dr. Seuss, is a fascinating movie to look at. Jim Carrey makes his performance as The Grinch all his own. He was literally the perfect choice to play the unlikable hairy creature with a hatred of Christmas. Even though he's not quite as funny as he's been in some of his earlier films, he's still fun to watch. The supporting cast is good too, especially 7-year-old newcomer Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who, the adorable little girl who tries to bring out the sweetness in The Grinch. But I think the best thing about ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is the spectacular production design by Michael Corenblith, who worked with Howard on ""Apollo 13"". He and his art directing-set decorating team have made the town of Whoville come to live like you've never seen before. The look of Whoville is a feast for the eyes, and it's fascinating. Also excellent, the make-up effects done by multi-Oscar winner Rick Baker. He's responsible for creating the make-up job on turning Carrey into The Grinch, and once again he and his make-up companions do an A+ job. I sure hope the Oscar voters are paying attention to this movie, because both the art direction and makeup should get Oscar nominations. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is a great film for the entire family, and judging by it's record breaking box office statistics, parents have been taking their kids in droves to see this. And well they should. It brought out the kid in me, and brought back memories of when I read the Dr. Seuss books when I was a child. ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" is fun, fun, fun. Only a few unnecessary vulgar jokes keep it from being perfect.***1/2 (out of four)","

","This movie was a great Christmas flick.  It did all the things that the old cartoon did, plus a lot more fun stuff.  I was afraid that I wouldn't like the movie since Jim Carey was in it--I've been scared off from his movies since I saw that whole horrible ""Ace Ventura"" trash.  Jim Carey or not, this movie was great.  I loved the childhood Grinch and all the new focus on the WHO'S of WHOVILLE.  Molly Shannon was great. I have no complaints about the movie. A+","

","Let me start by saying that up until now, I have always felt that the ""Wizard of Oz"" costumes and set design were the top of the line.   Now that I have see the ""Grinch"", I must push the Wizard aside.  The detail to the set as well as the costumes make this my new all time favourite.  Even the egg nog cup on top of Cindy Lou Who was incredible.  The liquid moved when she moved.  Thumbs up for all sets and costumes.  Ron Howard has given us his best effort to date.  All segments keep the audience glued to their seats.  Thanks for the great work Opie. (hope thats how you spell it)  And last but not least, (but he who is last shall be first) Jim Carey has once again brought total entertainment to another level.  He is just incredible. Thanks to Ron, Jim, the cast and crew.  I truly believe this is going to be a classic.  My only reservation is that I believe the level of humour might be above the comprehension of the little people.  The 6,7,8, and 9 year olds will not understand some of the humour.  I believe that the more mature adolescent and the adult kid (me) will appreciate the humour much more. But, the set and costumes will keep the little ones happy.  Thanks to the Grinch, we can really enjoy some good family entertainment once again.","

","I have read a smattering of the reviews here about the movie and what really gets me are the adults who went to see it and state that kids wouldn't enjoy it.  I went to see it the day after Thanksgiving and took three kids with me, ages 2, 6, and 9 and guess what?  They all LOVED it.  My 9 yo son and I laughed our butts off the whole time.  My 6 yo daughter also enjoyed the movie a great deal.  Jim Carrey was absolutely wonderful as the Grinch. His expressions and the way he moved were perfectly ""grinch-y"".  I thought the humor was great and the narration very appropriate.  My favorite part was the rendition of the song ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"".  That really had me rolling.  I think that the adults who went to see this movie and didn't like it need to really lighten up.  Kids aren't interested in ""acting ability"" or ""detailed storyline""; they just want to be entertained and the movie succeeded in that arena superbly.","
