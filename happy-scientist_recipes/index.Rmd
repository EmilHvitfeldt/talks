## What happens to the data between `read_data()` and `fit_model()`?

---

## Prices of 54,000 round cut diamonds

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
diamonds
```

---

## Formula expression in modeling

```{r lm, include = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
model <- lm(price ~ cut:color + carat + log(depth), 
            data = diamonds)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("lm") %>%
  flair("price", color = orange) %>%
  flair("cut:color + carat + log(depth)", color = blue)
```

- Select .orange[outcome] & .blue[predictors]

---

## Formula expression in modeling

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("lm") %>%
  flair("cut:color", color = orange)
```

- Select outcome & predictors

## Work under the hood - model.matrix

```{r, eval=FALSE}

             data = diamonds)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, output.lines=13}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lm(y ~ log(x01) + log(x02) + log(x03) + log(x04) + log(x05) + log(x06) + log(x07) +
       log(x08) + log(x09) + log(x10) + log(x11) + log(x12) + log(x13) + log(x14) + 
       log(x15) + log(x16) + log(x17) + log(x18) + log(x19) + log(x20) + log(x21) +

       log(x29) + log(x30) + log(x31) + log(x32) + log(x33) + log(x34) + log(x35),
   data = dat)
```

---

## Downsides

- Tedious typing with many variables
- Functions have to manually be applied to each variable
- **Operations are constrained to single columns**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Not possible
lm(y ~ pca(x01, x02, x03, x04, x05), data = dat)
```

---

## Downsides

- Tedious typing with many variables
- Functions have to manually be applied to each variable
- Operations are constrained to single columns
- **Everything happens at once**

You can't apply multiple transformations to the same variable.

## Downsides

- Tedious typing with many variables
- Functions have to manually be applied to each variable
- Operations are constrained to single columns
- Everything happens at once
- **Connected to the model, calculations are not saved between models**

One could manually use `model.matrix` and pass the result to the modeling function.

# Modularity and pipeability

```{r, eval=FALSE}
price ~ cut + color + carat + log(depth) + table
```

Taking the formula from before we can rewrite it as the following recipe

```{r rec1, eval=FALSE}
rec <- recipe(price ~ cut + color + carat + depth + table, 
              data = diamonds) %>%
  step_log(depth) %>%
  step_dummy(cut, color)
```

---

# Modularity and pipeability

```{r, eval=FALSE}
price ~ cut + color + carat + log(depth) + table
```

Taking the formula from before we can rewrite it as the following recipe

```{r echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec1") %>%
  flair("price ~ cut + color + carat + depth + table", color = orange)
```

.orange[formula] expression to specify variables

---

# Modularity and pipeability

```{r, eval=FALSE}
price ~ cut + color + carat + log(depth) + table
```

Taking the formula from before we can rewrite it as the following recipe

```{r echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec1") %>%
  flair("step_log(depth) %>%", color = orange)
```

then apply .orange[log] transformation on `depth`

---

# Modularity and pipeability

```{r, eval=FALSE}
price ~ cut + color + carat + log(depth) + table
```

Taking the formula from before we can rewrite it as the following recipe

```{r echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec1") %>%
  flair("step_dummy(cut, color)", color = orange)
```

lastly we create .orange[dummy variables] from `cut` and `color`

---

## Deferred evaluation

If we look at the recipe we created we don't see a dataset, but instead, we see a specification

```{r}
rec
```

---

## Deferred evaluation

**recipes** gives a specification of the intent of what we want to do.

No calculations have been carried out yet.

First we need to `prep()` the recipe. This will calculate the sufficient statistics needed to perform each of the steps. 

```{r}
prepped_rec <- prep(rec)
```

---

## Deferred evaluation

```{r}
prepped_rec
```

---

# Baking

After we have prepped the recipe we can `bake()` it to apply all the transformations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bake(prepped_rec, new_data = diamonds)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, output.lines=10}
dplyr::glimpse(bake(prepped_rec, new_data = diamonds), 80)
```

---

# Baking / Juicing

Since the dataset is already calculated after running `prep()` can we use `juice()` to extract it

```{r, eval=FALSE}
juice(prepped_rec)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, output.lines=10}
dplyr::glimpse(juice(prepped_rec), 80)
```

## Isolates test & training data

When working with data for predictive modeling it is important to make sure any information from the test data leaks into the training data.

This is avoided by using **recipes** by making sure you only prep the recipe with the training dataset.

# Can do things formulas can't

# selectors

```{r rec2, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
rec <- recipe(price ~ ., data = diamonds) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_zv(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors())
```

.pull-left[
It can be annoying to manually specify variables by name.

Use of selectors can greatly help you!
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec2")
```
]

---

# selectors

.pull-left[
.orange[`all_nominal()`] is used to select all the nominal variables. 
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec2") %>%
  flair("all_nominal()", color = orange)  
```
]

---

# selectors

.pull-left[
.orange[`all_numeric()`] is used to select all the numeric variables. 

Even the ones generated by .blue[`step_dummy()`]
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec2") %>%
  flair("all_numeric()", color = orange) %>%
  flair("step_dummy", color = blue)
```
]

---

# selectors

.pull-left[
.orange[`all_predictors()`] is used to select all predictor variables. 

Will not break even if a variable is removed with .blue[`step_zv()`]
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec2") %>%
  flair("all_predictors()", color = orange) %>%
  flair("step_zv", color = blue)
```
]

---

# Roles

```{r rec3, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
rec <- recipe(price ~ ., data = diamonds) %>%
  update_role(x, y, z, new_role = "size") %>%
  step_log(has_role("size")) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_zv(all_numeric()) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors())
```

.pull-left[
.orange[`update_role()`] can be used to give variables roles.

That then can be selected with .blue[`has_role()`]

Roles can also be set with `role = ` argument inside steps
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec3") %>%
  flair("update_role", color = orange) %>%
  flair("has_role", color = blue)
```
]

---

## PCA extraction

```{r rec4, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
rec <- recipe(price ~ ., data = diamonds) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_pca(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.8)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
decorate("rec4") %>%
  flair("step_pca", color = orange) %>%
  flair("threshold = 0.8", color = blue)
```

You can also write a recipe that extract enough .orange[principal components] to expain .blue[80% of the variance]

Loadings will be kept in the prepped recipe to make sure other datasets are transformed correctly

---

## Imputation

**recipes** does by default NOT deal with missing data.

There are many steps to perform imputation, some include `step_knnimpute()`, `step_meanimpute()` and `step_medianimpute()` for numerics and `step_unknown()` for factors.
